We identify a robust set of contractual loan characteristics, borrower characteristics, and macroeconomic variables that are important in determining the likelihood of default, such as loan maturity, homeownership, loan purposes, occupation, etc. We also find an important role of alternative data in determining the default, even after controlling for the obvious risk characteristics of the borrowers, loan characteristics, and the local economic factors. The results are robust to different empirical approaches. Results imply that it would be important for regulators to provide greater transparency in terms of guidance and regulatory clarity on which alternative data can be used legally without violating fair lending rules. Lenders need to pay closer attention to how they make decisions and understand their own decisions that may be driven by complex algorithms inside the “black boxes.” © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Crowdfunding; Financial innovation; Household finance; Lasso selection methods; Machine learning; P2P/marketplace lending; Peer to peer lending",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Do Marketplace Lending Platforms Offer Lower Rates to Consumers?

This study analyse government regulations on financial services authority regulation No. 77/POJK.01/2016 concerning Information Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services, even though it has been regulated about lending and borrowing services, the government does not seem ready enough to faceagainst regulatory issues related to criminal acts related to the protection of personal data. Basically, the problems that arise require the consequences of inter-agency or ministerial relations, for example in the ministry of communication and information (kemkominfo) with financial service authority institutions. Through the method of statute approach, qualitatively, this study shows that the government needs to use the regulations of lexspecialis to protect customer data that is often misused by many loan service companies through online technology. © 2020 SERSC.","Data Protection; Government Role; P2P Lending",,,,,,"Baenanda, L., Mengenal Lebih Jauh Revolusi Industri 4.0, , http://binus.ac.id/knowledge/2019/05/mengenal-lebih-jauh-revolusi-industri-4-0/; Wijayani, R., (2017) Perlindungan Hak Konsumen Selaku Debitur Dan Kreditur Pada Transaksi Peer to Peer (P2P) Lending Financial Technology, , Yogyakarta: Tesis Magister Universitas Gadjah Mada; Keuangan, O.J., Perkembangan Fintech Lending, , https://www.ojk.go.id/id/kanal/iknb/data-dan-statistik/fintech/Documents/Perkembangan%20Fintech%20Lending%20Periode%20Juli%202019.pdf; Pratiwi, D.R., Pentingnya Perkembangan Financial Technology dana Mendorong Keuangan Inklusif (2018) Buletin APBN (Pusat Kajian Anggaran Badan Keahlian DPR RI), III; Indriani, D.P.A.M., Data Protection in Financial Technology Services (2018) Sriwijaya Law Review, 2 (1); Mutiara, R.R., Construction of Financial Technology in Banking Systems in Indonesia (2019) Jurnal Hukum Novelty, 10 (2), pp. 150-163; (2009) Metode Penelitian Pendidikan, , Bandung: Alfabeta; (2017) IOSCO Research Report on Financial Technologies (Fintech); Riadi, A.B., Aspek Hukum dalam Menjalankan Perusahaan Fintech Lending di Indonesia (2018) Prihatwono Law Research, 1, p. 1; (2017) Kajian Perlindungan Konsumen Sektor Jasa Keuangan, , Perlindungan Konsumen pada Fintech, Jakarta: Otoritas Jasa Keuangan; Online, H., Prinsip-Prinsip Ini Wajib Diterapkan Dalam Industri Fintech, , https://www.hukumonline.com/berita/baca/lt5addc899cd8a0/prinsip-prinsip-ini-wajib-diterapkan-dalam-industri-fintech/, Hukum; Kagan, J., Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Lending, , https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-to-peer-lending.asp, Investopedia; Keuangan, O.J., Siaran Pers Satgas Waspada Investasi Kembali Hentikan140 Fintech Peer-To-Peer Lending Tanpa Izin, , https://www.ojk.go.id/id/berita-dan-kegiatan/siaran-pers/Pages/Siaran-Pers--Satgas-Waspada-Investasi-Kembali-Hentikan-140-Fintech-Peer-To-Peer-Lending-Tanpa-Izin.aspx, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan; Suwandono, A., (2006) Ruang Lingkup Hukum Perlindungan Konsumen, , Tangerang Selatan: Universitas Terbuka; Syahputra, A.M., (2018) Perlindungan Konsumen Atas Hak Uang Kembalian Dalam Perjanjian Jual-Beli Pada Supermarket Di Yogyakarta, , Yogyakarta: Skripsi Program Studi S1 Ilmu Hukum Fakultas Hukum Universitas Islam Indonesia; Raharjo, S., Hukum, I., Bandung, P.T., Bakti, C.A., (2000); Article 1 Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 10/12/2017 concerning the Implementation of Financial Technology; Undang-Undang Indonesia Nomor 19 Tahun 2016 Tentang Informasi Dan Transaksi Elektronik","Irawan, I.; Universitas Pembangunan Nasional Veteran JakartaIndonesia",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

Financial technology or Fintech is a term used to describe the technological innovation in the financial sector; has seen various major breakthroughs over the past decade, and Bitcoin was right at the center stage. Clearly, a lack of public trust on financial systems after the global financial crisis which describes to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 which started from the subprime mortgage market in the U.S has given cryptocurrency an opportunity to enter the market. Since then, the industry has been growing at a rapid pace driven by increasing acceptance, greater media coverage, sustained inflows, initial coin offering 3 (ICO) frenzy and increased transaction capacity. This study aims to fill the gap by providing insight into the world of cryptocurrency from a Chinese investment perspective. The findings will help the global audience (not limited to those with domicile in China) understand the implication of cryptocurrency as an alternative investment in China. Therefore, this study strives to contribute to the literature and open up a gateway for more future research on FinTech in China. © 2020 Mattingley Publishing.

In conditions of a gradual transition to project financing of housing construction, developers and banks face with the problem of the deficite of resources to finance all new buildings and the completion of projects. The project financing mechanism remains incompletely developed; only the basic principles of the project financing mechanism work are indicated. There is no regulatory legal framework, so it is difficult to evaluate these initiatives. The Russian banking system is not ready to fully provide loans at the request of housing developers, because it does not have sufficient financial resources. Banking products using escrow accounts are in the formation stage, which is of interest in considering other forms of financing of construction objects, in particular, using the crowdfunding technology, the possibilities and advantages of which are discussed in a scientific article. The technology of crowdfunding can be used by commercial banks by creating an Internet site for attracting public funds to implement a targeted project online. Previously, the bank's task is to assess the reality, effectiveness and timing of the project in order to reduce risks.

Bahrain is considered as the hub of Islamic banking in the GCC and all over the world. Bahrain has the largest concentration of Islamic banks in the world. The main objective of this study is to find the impact of agility and Fintech on the future of Islamic banking in Bahrain. The research has used mainly secondary data for its study.

It is potentially one of the game changing disruptive forces which have transformed the financial ecosystem leveraging the throughput of banking and financial services. The advent of financial technology has given much needed impetus to the otherwise struggling financial institutions, which have been able to cut down a lot on redundant costs. Resultantly, the institutions have been able to maximise operating efficiency and reduce costs to a large extent. The technology backed financial landscape has been improved over a period of time with results being evident in its profitability and other allied ratios. This research paper discusses a probable role which financial technology has played in the profitability of the financial institutions specifically banks in Indian context. © 2020 IJSTR.","Banking Sector; Financial Institutions; Financial Technology Financial Technology; FinTech; Operating Efficiency; Profitability",,,,,,"Christensen, C., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change The Way You Do Business, , HarperBusiness, New York, NY; Dapp, T.F., Slomka, L., Ag, D.B., Hoffmann, R., Fintech-The digital (R) evolution in the financial sector (2014) Deutsche Bank; Davies, S., Shipman, J., Kashyap, M., (2018) Article.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

It begins by clarifying the definition of these concepts. Through a systematic review and case studies in the supply chain industry, this paper brings out the applications, the benefits/value, and the challenges/issues of Bitcoin, Blockchain and Fintech in several industries. It also presents the research methodologies/approaches used during such research. The classification framework developed and used to perform an analysis of 141 articles from five top academic databases serves as a baseline study. It offers the opportunity to evaluate the level of knowledge on Bitcoin, Blockchain and Fintech, and their evolution over time. The findings show that these technologies are evolving, and organizations are embracing them for competitive advantage. Thus, organizations need to leverage research on these technologies to better understand them, optimize their business strategies, and develop critical insights for decision-making. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Fintech; supply chain","Blockchain; Classification (of information); Competition; Decision making; Supply chains; Baseline studies; Business strategy; Classification framework; Competitive advantage; Fintech; Knowledge gaps; Research methodologies; Systematic Review; Bitcoin",,,,,"Abboushi, S., Global Virtual Currency.

The FinTech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services. The study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth. The study finds that FinTech startups are positively correlated with Indonesia’s economic growth. FinTech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on Indonesia’s economic growth; however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year. These findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (FDI), stock market development, and trade openness. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

Unfortunately, the academic literature has paid little attention to the role of ecosystem development and evolution in relation to disruptive innovations. To overcome this oversight, our study defines disruptive innovation ecosystems and illustrates the impact that the financial technology (FinTech) ecosystem has had on disrupting the financial services industry. We offer an agenda for future research on disruptive innovations and ecosystems and discuss the evolution of the FinTech ecosystem. Our study shows that disruptive innovation ecosystems are not only in need of but also deserving of further attention. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Digitalization; Disruptive innovation; Ecosystems; Entrepreneurship; Financial technology; FinTech; Incumbents","Artificial intelligence; Finance; Digitalization; Disruptive innovations; Entrepreneurship; FinTech; Incumbents; Ecosystems; artificial intelligence; digitization; entrepreneur; financial services; future prospect; information technology; innovation; Malus x domestica",,,,,"The Rise of Insurtech (2017), London, UK; Adner, R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem (2006) Harv.

With the rise of technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence in recent years, agent-based modeling and basic supporting technologies in the field of FinTech are deeply integrated to jointly promote continuous breakthroughs in FinTech. In particular, in the fields of big data ontology research, agent-based model calibration, investor behavior modeling, regulatory technology applications, etc., agent-based modeling has demonstrated its unique advantages in integrating with FinTech. From the perspectives of big data ontology, agent-based modeling is an effective method that uses financial big data ontology modeling to depict the correlation between financial entities and to study their causal relationships. From the perspectives of artificial intelligence, it provides the basis for fine modeling of individuals and behavioral evolution modeling, and agent-based modeling provides a new research frame-work for algorithmic trading. From the perspectives of regulatory technology, the agent-based model in the development process to promote the formation of a new 'scenario-response' type of risk management, thus providing supports for the 'regulatory technology' development. This paper holds that agent-based modeling can be integrated with the basic supporting technologies of FinTech, providing an important impetus for the development of agent-based modeling and regulatory innovation in FinTech. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

The technology-based financial services company in Indonesia grows faster, resulting in the disruption of financial services companies, including Sharia banks. Several studies have discussed the opportunity of cooperation between Sharia banks and Fintech companies to increase the market share of Sharia banks and to write economic inclusion.In the study used methods of descriptive analysis with secondary data and literature studies. The findings in this study are that sharia banks in the economic disruption era have a greater challenge in achieving target market share. The cooperation opportunities with Fintech companies also have challenges in terms of legal certainty and sharia aspect direction. However, Fintech is expected to help sharia banks reach its market share target. This research provides the right cooperation solution that sharia banks can do with Fintech companies. © IJSTR 2020.","Economic digitalization; Financial services industry; Industry revolution 4.0",,,,,,"Arner, D.W., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, , Journal The HKU Scholars Hub, The University Of Hong Kong; Ariyanti, F., (2017) Perusahaan Harus Ubah Strategi Demi Bertahan Di Era Digital, , Liputan6.com, 22 September; Firmansyah, E.A.A., Islamic Financial Technology (Fintech): Its Challenges and Prospect (2019) Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research (ASSEHR), 216; Griffoli, T.M., Banking on change (2017) Finance & Development (September), 54 (3). , Vol., No., Washington DC, International Monetary Funds; Hadad, M.D., (2017) Financial Technology (Fintech) Di Indonesia, , Kuliah Umum Fintech, IBS, Jakarta; Hapsari, R.A., Maronisatria, I., Ariani, Dwi, N., The Existence of Regulatory Sandbox to Encourage the Growth of Financial Technology in Indonesia (2019) Fiat Justisia, 13 (3), pp. 271-288; Iman, N., Fintech, Islamic Finance, and Its Challenges (2017) Indonesia Sharia Economic Festival, , Surabaya,, 10 November; Warman, K.A., (2018) Managing the Impact of Fintech: Case of Indonesia Islamic Banks, , Makasar, 4 Juli; Bilpen, N., (2017) Kajian Bisnis Fintech Syariah, , PT Telkom; Muhammad Afdi, N., Teknologi Keuangan (Fintech): Konsep Dan Implementasinya di Indonesia (2017) Warta Fiskal.

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error. We have to manage our work and time differently. We are living in a digital and intelligent era, where machines take over repetitive, time-consuming and redundant tasks, giving finance professionals more time to approach higher level and more lucrative analysis and research. © 2020, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

The rapid development of fintech in Indonesia was responded positively by the existence of several regulations issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank Indonesia (BI). Besides conventional fintech, sharia fintech in Indonesia has also begun to develop where the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has issued a fatwa on Sharia-Based Information Technology-Based Financing Services (Fatwa No.117 / DSN-MUI / IX / 2018). Although sharia fintech has begun to develop, OJK has not accommodated the MUI Fatwa to be a binding regulation. This will give an impact on legal uncertainty regarding supervising of sharia fintech. Ironically, both conventional and sharia fintech become a tool of crime related to the misused of consumer personal data unlawfully. To answer the problem, the methodology used of this article is juridical-normative with qualitative approach. The result of this study is although there are some regulations both conventional and sharia fintech, there are still violations of the law that harm consumers such as approval, supervision, law enforcement including violation of consumer personal data and the culture. Those have an impact on legal uncertainty for consumers because there is no legal protection provided by the state. © 2019 SERSC.","Consumers and Legal Protection; Financial Technology; Personal Data",,,,,,"Ridwan Aji, P., Tumbuh Pesat, 135 Perusahaan Fintech Kini Ada Di Indonesia, , https://ekonomi.kompas.com/read/2018/04/13/2148004, Kompas.com; Cooper, T., The Race to Become the world’s Leading Islamic Fintech Hub, , https://www.raconteur.net/finance/race-become-worlds-leading-leading-islamic-fintech-hub; Amalia, E.I.R., Strategic Alliances between Sharia Microfinance Institutions and Financial Technology in Strengthening Small Micro Enterprises for Socio Economic Justice” (2018) Proceeding of the 2Nd Interational on Law and Justice (ICLJ) Faculty of Sharia and Law UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Indonesia, pp. 10-11; Miskan, S., Shahwahid, F.M., Sholehudin, N.B., Catching The Fintech Wave in Islamic Finance: Regulatory Approach for Malaysia” (2018) Proceeding of the 4Th Muzakarah Fiqh and Iternational Fiqh Conference (MFIFC), , Kuala Lumpur Malaysia) October 17; Arner, D.W., Barberist, J., Buckley, R.P., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm (2016) Georgetown Journal of Internasional Law, 47; Raharjo, S., (2000) Ilmu Hukum, p. 5. , Bandung: PT.Citra Aditya Bakti; Hadjon, M.P., (1987) Perlindungan Hukum Bagi Rakyat Indonesia, p. 2. , Surabaya: PT.

Our result shows that loan and borrowers’ specific factors are significantly associated with the loan rate and loan default, although the relation could differ from one platform to another. Our empirical result shows that platforms focused on very small loan for microbusiness increase their interest rate after the introduction of formal regulation. It could be because of the increase of the borrowers requiring a very small amount of loan relatively much more than the number of lenders. The shortfall of supply then drives the increase in loan rate.

The informants of this research were from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) as the agency that supervises Fintech's performance. This research used empirical juridical legal approach by examining the regulations and then proceeding with interviews. The analysis technique used was the descriptive method to explain various symptoms and facts in everyday life. Normative data from this study were from laws, journals, several regulations, and other materials, while empirical data was obtained from interviews with OJK. The results showed that the mechanism of the Regulatory Sandbox was run in accordance with the Regulations of the Governor Board Members Number 19/14/PADG/2017, concerning the limited testing room (Regulatory Sandbox) of Financial technology and POJK RI Number 13/POJK.02/2018, regarding Digital Financial Innovation in the Financial Services Sector. However, the existing regulations of the Regulatory Sandbox was considered unable to provide legal certainty for the financial technology organisers, because the applied mechanism took a long time. This made the objective of this mechanism application to cut the time needed for obtaining a permit for a Fintech product to be launched in the market, was unable to be achieved. The government should provide simplifications of the implementation of this mechanism, without reducing the quality of the Fintech products to be marketed. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Financial technology; OJK; Regulatory sandbox",,,,,,"Aaron, M., Rivadeneyra, F., Sohal, S., (2017) Fintech: Is This Time Different?: A Framework for Assessing Risks and Opportunities for Central Banks, , Bank of Canada; Abolfathi, E., Taebi, P., Modern Analysis of Financial Statements: Pharmaceutical companies in Iran (2019) Journal of Management and Accounting Studies, 7 (2), pp. 19-23; Ahn, I., Deconstructing the Economy of Debt: Karl Marx, Jürgen Habermas, and an Ethics of Debt (2013) Trans Humanities, 6 (1); Aliya, R., Muhammad, S.A., Putri, I., (2018) Diakses pada, , https://kliklegal.com/regulatory-sandbox-sebagai-upaya-akselerasi-hukum-terhadap-inovasi-dalam-financial-technology-quo-vadis-ailrc/; Amalina, F., The Fintech Book: The Financial Technology Handbookfor Investor, Entrepreneurs And Visionaries Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, 31 (3); Ansori, M., Perkembangan dan Dampak Financial Technology (Fintech) terhadap industry keuangan syariah di Jawa Tengah (2019) Jurnal studi keislaman, 5 (1); Saurykova, Z.M., Ybyraimzhanov, K., Mailybaeva, G., Implementation of interdisciplinary relationships in education on the basis of science integration (2018) Opción, 34, pp. 353-385. , 85-2; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Regulating FinTech Innovation: A Balancing Act (2015) Asian Institute of International Financial Law; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., Fintech, Regtech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation (2016) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business; Chattha, J.A., FinTech and Islamic Finance: A Regulatory Perspective (2017) Global halal investing journal; Chisti, S., Barberis, J., (2016) The Fintech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, , West Sussex: John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Cresswell, J.W., (2003) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Method Approaches (2nd ed.), , California: SAGE Publications; Dahlberg, T., Past, present and future of mobile payments research A literature review (2007) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications; Dhar, V., Stein, R.M., FinTech Platforms and Strategy (2017) MIT Sloan School Working Paper 5183-16; Dhar, Stein, R., FinTech Platforms and Strategy: Integrating Trust and Automation in Finance (2017) Communications of the ACM, 60 (10); Fajar, M., Achmad, Y., (2010) Dualisme Penelitian Hukum Normatif dan Empiris, , Yogyakarta: Pustaka Pelajar; Fakhriah, S., Ikhwansyah, Permohonan upaya hukum peninjauan kembali kedua kali (2017) Jurnal Berkala fakultas hukum UGM, 29 (2); (2015) Regulatory Sandbox, , Financial Conduct Authority.

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted structural equation modeling using the partial least squares approach to test the hypotheses. Based on purposive sampling, the questionnaire was distributed through an online survey and received 1,262 responses. Findings: The results demonstrate that the latent variables, planned behavior, acceptance model and use of technology, have a significant impact on encouraging behavioral intentions to use Islamic FinTech. The “acceptance model” latent variable is the most influential factor. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only in Indonesia; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to other countries. However, the study provides important strategic guidelines for policymakers in designing a framework to enhance the development of Islamic FinTech and to achieve financial inclusion. It is suggested that future studies include samples from FinTech users in different countries. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature especially on the factors affecting behavioral intentions to use Islamic FinTech. There are limited studies concerning this topic, especially for Indonesia. The unique feature of this study is the use of a large primary data set that covers most provinces in Indonesia. Furthermore, this study focuses on three types of Islamic FinTech, namely, payments, peer to peer lending and crowdfunding. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intention; Indonesia; Islamic financial services marketing; Islamic financial technology",,,,,,"Aaron, M., Rivadeneyra, F., Sohal, S., (2017) Fintech: is this time different?

In the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency. The research finds that: (1) The key to improving the efficiency of input and output of China's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology; (2) The key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation. (3) The improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector. It can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation. © 2020 IEEE.","Credit constraint; Financial frontier technology; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technology efficiency","Efficiency; Engineering research; Facings; Fintech; Industrial research; Service industry; Stochastic systems; Credit constraints; Efficiency measurement; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technological innovation; Technology efficiency; Transmission mechanisms; Utilization efficiency; Industrial economics",,,,,"Gulen, H., Ion, M., Policy uncertainty and corporate investment (2016) Rev.

The study drew from the fact that there is significant latent demand for digital payments in many markets of sub-Saharan Africa, and widespread consumer acceptance of mobile-communications technology is highly encouraging. The study sought to examine the effect of technology, among other things, on money demand. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used panel data and a GMM panel technique to analyse the study's findings. Findings: Results showed that all variables that captured financial technology have a negative effect with money demand (MD). Both Mobile Subscriptions (MS) and ATM (Automated Teller Machines) have a negative relationship with money demand (MD). Practical implications: Based on the results obtained in this study, the study recommended that Central Banks need to monitor and predict the consequences of financial innovations. As African states proceed with reforms of its financial sector, the stability of the demand for money would have to be reexamined and instruments of the Central Bank modified to ensure an effective control of money demand. Originality/Value: A little has been done on the effect of technological developments on money demand in Africa. An understanding of the way technological developments may positively or negatively impact on money demand may guide Central banks in adopting and implementing appropriate monetary policies and actions. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Particularly, the purpose is to identify a benchmark profile of CEOs and to understand which are the main features (e.g. age, tenure, education specification, education level, gender, nationality, years of entrepreneurship, years in financial functions, years in IT functions), giving more opportunity to develop and maintain sustainable business models using innovative platforms. Design/methodology/approach: The research questions are answered through a quali-quantitative methodology using descriptive and statistical approaches. The researchers collected a sample of 100 Fintech firms from the main Fintech firms in 2018 identified by the annual KPMG Report (2019). Thus, the research observed and tested the average level of the major CEO demographic features. Additionally, the paper explored whether these variables have a major probability to affect Fintech leading. Findings: Assuming a relevant part of Fintech firms, the main results of this paper show the relevance of several CEO demographic characteristics. Additionally, the age, the tenure and the presence of an MBA are significant elements in affecting Leading companies. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it contributes to the literature examining the internal governance and sustainable business model, still not explored. Moreover, this study contributes to identifying the CEO demographic characteristics that foster financial institutions' transition towards sustainable business models. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CEO; Cultural drift; Fintech; Platforms; Smart technologies; Sustainability; Sustainable business model",,,,,,"Adams, R.B., Almeida, H., Ferreira, D., Powerful CEOs and their impact on corporate performance (2005) The Review of Financial Studies, 18 (4), pp. 1403-1432; Adams, R., Jeanrenaud, S., Bessant, J., Denyer, D., Overy, P., Sustainability‐oriented innovation: a systematic review (2016) International Journal of Management Reviews, 18 (2), pp. 180-205; Amit, R., Zott, C., Creating value through business model innovation (2012) MIT Sloan Management Review, 53 (3), pp. 41-49; Anderson, D., The integration of gender and political behaviour into Hambrick and Mason's upper echelons model of organizations (2003) Journal of American Academy of Business, 3 (1-2), p. 29; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top management and innovations in banking: does the composition of the top team make a difference?

However, while developing, it will also bring certain risks. Therefore, relevant departments should actively do well. Preventive measures to effectively manage computer security risks and avoid financial risks. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks. There are many kinds of financial technology risks. The role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks is also multi-faceted. This paper studies the systemic risks of China's banking industry through Internet finance. The impact of this is to explore the role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks. In this paper, the dynamic CoVaR model analysis method and quantile regression method are used to construct a test model of Internet finance and banking systemic risk. The research results show that the regression coefficient between Internet finance and banking systemic risk CoVaR is 0.933, and significant at the 1% confidence level, indicates that in the sample interval, the development of Internet finance has increased the systemic risk level of the banking industry as a whole. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Computer security management; financial technology; Internet finance; risk prevention",,,,,,"Zhuting, P.A.N., Network information security: a game that ever changes (2016) Sci Technol Rev, 34 (14), pp. 107-112; Qian, X., Liu, X., Pei, J., A game-theoretic analysis of information security investment for multiple firms in a network (2017) J Oper Res Soc, 68 (10), pp. 1290-1305; Al-Dhafian, B., Ahmad, I., Hussain, M., Improving the security in healthcare information system through elman neural network based classifier (2017) J Med Imaging Health Inform, 7 (6), pp. 1429-1435; Garg, S., Peddoju, S.K., Sarje, A.K., Network-based detection of Android malicious apps (2017) Int J Inf Secur, 16 (4), pp. 385-400; Wolff, J., Perverse effects in defense of computer systems: when more is less (2016) J Manage Inf Syst, 33 (2), pp. 597-620; Zegzhda, P., Pavlenko, E.Y., Cyber-physical system homeostatic security management (2017) Autom Control Comput Sci, 51 (8), pp. 805-816; Kurniawan, E., Riadi, I., Security level analysis of academic information systems based on standard ISO 27002:2003 using SSE-CMM (2018) Int J Comput Sci Inf Secur, 16 (1), pp. 139-147; Olaniyi, O.M., Arulogun, O.T., Omidiora, O.E., Implementing generic security requirements in e-voting using modified stegano-cryptographic approach (2015) Int J Inf Comput Secur, 7 (1), p. 64; Batista, B.G., Kuehne, B.T., Leite Filho, D.M., Security overhead on a service with automatic resource management: a performance analysis (2019) Comput J, 62 (2), pp. 161-173; Dongdong, L., Shiliang, X., Yan, Z., Role - based access control in educational administration system (2017) Netw Comput Secur, 139 (10), p. 00120; Usman, L.M., Terrorism and female teacher leadership in girls’ secondary school (2018) Int J Educ Manage, 32 (2); Liaqat, M., Chang, V., Gani, A., Federated cloud resource management: review and discussion (2017) J Netw Comput Appl, 77 (C), pp. 87-105; Sarens, G., D’Onza, G., The perception of financial analysts on risk, risk management, and internal control disclosure: evidence from Belgium and Italy (2016) Int J Discl Gov, 14 (2), pp. 1-21; Sharma, D., Prinja, S., Aggarwal, A., Out-of-pocket expenditure for hospitalization in Haryana State of India: extent, determinants & financial risk protection (2017) Indian J Med Res, 146 (6), p. 759; Spanakis, E.K., Levitt, D.L., Siddiqui, T., The effect of continuous glucose monitoring in preventing inpatient hypoglycemia in general wards: the glucose telemetry system (2017) J Diabetes Sci Technol, 12 (1). , 193229681774896; Jaoude, G.J.A., Skordis-Worrall, J., Haghparast-Bidgoli, H., Measuring financial risk protection in health benefits packages: scoping review protocol to inform allocative efficiency studies (2019) BMJ Open, 9 (5), p. e026554; Chan, E.Y., Physically-attractive males increase men’s financial risk-taking (2015) Evol Hum Behav, 36 (5), pp. 407-413; Retchin, S.M., Responding to the marketplace: workforce balance and financial risk at academic health centers (2016) Acad Med, 91 (7), p. 908; Hsu, F.J., Chen, Y.-C., Is a firm’s financial risk associated with corporate social responsibility?

This is essential to establish a “Social Licence” for current and future practices. The notion of a “Social Licence” recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable. Establishing a Social Licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values. While the concept of the Social Licence is well-established in other sectors – notably in relation to extractive industries – it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries. This article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the Social Licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a Social Licence for emerging data-intensive industries. Additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries. In doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a Social Licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice. We focus on one key industry: Financial Technology. We demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to Artificial Intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a Social Licence for Financial Technology. Such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice. This is important to underpin culture change and to move beyond rhetorical commitments to develop best practice putting ethics at the heart of innovation. © The Author(s) 2020.","data; ethics; Financial Technology; responsible artificial intelligence; social licence; trust",,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Beygelzimer, A., Dudík, M., (2018), (,) A reductions aroach to fair classification; Aitken, M., Cunningham-Burley, S., Pagliari, C., Moving from trust to trustworthiness: Experiences of public engagement in the Scottish Health Informatics Programme (2016) Science & Public Policy, 43 (5), pp. 713-723. , (, a; Aitken, M., Haggett, C., Rudolph, D., Practices and rationales of community engagement with wind farms: Awareness raising, consultation, empowerment (2016) Planning Theory & Practice, 17 (4), pp. 557-576. , (, b; Aitken, M., Tully, M.P., Porteous, C., Consensus statement on public involvement and engagement with data-intensive health research (2019) International Journal of Population Data Science, 4 (1), pp. 1-6; Allen J, Adams C and Flack F 2019.

But they have not yet received proper development in Russian practice. Therefore, the study aims to develop diagnostic and managerial tools of a financial nature, focused on improving the competitiveness of enterprises of the mineral resource complex (MRC). System analysis, statistical, financial and economic, retrospective, and trend analysis, along with the principles of consistency and development, formed the methodological basis of the study. The authors examine the mechanisms for implementing financial instruments to ensure competitiveness on the example of Russian enterprises of the mineral resource complex. The empirical research methodology is justified, and financial factors determining the level of competitiveness are determined. The resulting integral indicator of the competitiveness of MRC enterprises is proposed. The indicator makes it possible to assess its level both in the industry as a whole and for an individual MRC enterprise. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Competitiveness; Financial instrumentation; Mineral resource complex enterprises",,,,,,"Brooking, A., (2001) Intellectual Capital, , In: Kovalik, L.N.

This article attempts to capture the discussion on fintech, to provide a critique of the literature, and to propose future research opportunities. In order to do so, a list of peer-reviewed journals was compiled, identified, examined, coded, and classified into high-level themes to be reviewed, analysed, and interpreted. After synthesising the notion of fintech in the literature, this article proposes several potential areas for further exploration, divided into the following themes: definition, attributes, adoption, regulation, and competition. Fintech or financial technology is a relatively new subject in the literature but commonly cited as one of the most important innovations in the financial industry. It is expected that this article will help researchers and academics who are interested in studying the phenomenon more broadly. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The increasing of online loan applications is one of the impacts of these technological development. However, the problem is that there are many of these applications that do not have a license to provide financial services yet. Whereas the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in this case has required every financial technology to register a license to operate. Noted, 1,330 people reported to the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), there are 89 financial technology applications with the Peer to Peer Lending platform that are suspected of violating laws and human rights against debitors. The report indicates, the ease of lending in online applications makes customers increasingly entangled. The focus of the writer in this paper is how to protect the debitors customers against the debitors information data, as well as how to sanction applications that are arbitrary and do not yet have a granting permit from the Financial Services Authority (OJK). This paper uses normative research method using statute approach and case approach. The findings of this paper are expected to provide an explanation of consumer protection and the legality of financial technology in Indonesia. © 2020 IJSTR.","And Peer to Peer Lending; Consumer Protection; Financial Technology",,,,,,"(2019), https://id.techinasia.com/10-layanan-fintech-pertumbuhan-tercepat; POJK Number 77/POJK.01/2016, 2016, p (2016) Article 1 Paragraph (3); (2019), https://www.Cnbcindonesia.com/tech/20190703162426-37-82491/ojk-kind-find-140-fintech-ilegal-ini-; https://duwitmu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/144-DList-P2P-Lending-Ilegal-april-2019-OJK.pdf; https://www.ojk.go.id/id/berita-dan-kegiatan/siaran-pers/Pages/Siaran-Pers-Satgas-Temukan-123-Fintech-Lending-Ilegal,-30-Gadai-Swasta-dan-49-Entitas-Penawaran-Investasi-Tanpa-Izin.aspx; https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/tech/20190703162426-37-82491/ojk-find-140-fintech-legal-access-accessed, Available:, [Accessed 20 September 2019]; https://www.Businessinsider.com/peer-to–peer-lending-how-digital-lending-marketplaces-are-disrupting-the-predominant-banking-model-2015-5?IR=T, [Online].

It is simply termed as financial technology in which computer programs and other technology is used to support banking as well as financial services. According to many studies Fin- tech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilizes at least two or more fin- tech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fin- tech as a part of their daily lives. Entry of Fin- Tech firms in the banking industry has compelled banks to look for new offerings by creating the best environment for innovation with the help of Fin- Techs, considering them as a partner rather than a competitor. Initially, the term was applied to technology which is applied to the back-end of established consumer and trade financial institutions. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the term has extended to incorporate any technological innovation in the financial sector, with innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies. The objective of the study is to analyze the role played by fin- tech in banking services and the opportunities which are serving banking services and the challenges faced by banking sector. Descriptive type of research is used for the study. Secondary as well as primary data has been gathered for the study. The sources for the data are through the websites of the fin- tech companies and banks. The study briefly explains the role played by fin- tech in banks overall development. This helps banks to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market. The study describes the opportunities for banking sector and clearly explains the problems faced by banking sector. The study analyzes the basic terms, objectives of research, assumptions and limitations. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","Banking services; Challenges; Fin- tech; Opportunities; Role",,,,,,"(2018) Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors; Bank for International Settlements.; Diamond, D., Dybvig, P., Bank runs, deposit insurance and liquidity (1983) Journal of Political Economy.; Holmström, B., Tirole, J., Financial intermediation, loanable funds, and the real sector (1997) Quarterly Journal of Economics.; Kelly, S., Ferenzy, D., McGrath, A., (2017) How Financial Institutions and Fintechs Are Partnering for Inclusion: Lessons from the Flontlines., , Working paper of the Institute of International Finance; Leland, H., Pyle, D., Informational asymmetries, financial structure and financial intermediation (1977) The Journal of Finance.; Bergara, M., Ponce, J., (2017) How Disruptive Are Fin- Techs?; Bhuvana, M., Thirumagal, P.G., Vasantha, S., Big data analytics - A leveraging technology for indian commercial banks (2016) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9 (32); Arner, D.W., (2016) Fin- Tech and Reg Tech: Opportunities and Challenges.; Ozili, P.K., (2018) Impact of Digital Finance on Financial Inclusion and Stability;, , Jan, University of Essex; Munich Personal RePEc Archive; Philippon, T., (2017) The FinTech Opportunity., , BIS Working Paper 655; Saranya, J., Anitha, K., Vasantha, S., An empirical study on role of ICT in banking sector (2014) IJMCR, 2",,,,"Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

The authors analyze modern ecosystem and Fintech’s global trends, their influence on the transformation of principles, models and emergence of new threats of traditional financial intermediation. The trends of FinTech distribution in Ukraine are considered. The areas of activity of traditional financial intermediaries, which require the use of the latest technological tools, the possible effects of the influence of modern regulatory standards on the banking sphere are studied. The authors describe features of RegTech application for improvement financial intermediaries risk management systems, usage of innovative regulatory technology tools that can enhance the quality and efficiency of financial institutions compliance systems as a prerequisite for increasing the protection of depositors, creditors and investors interests. New opportunities for cooperation between traditional financial intermediaries and RegTech companies are examined. Post-crisis world-view changes in the formulation of targets for the use of financial innovations and FinTech are substantiated. The spectrum of potential financial stability risks posed by FinTech, which requires systematic monitoring by entities providing financial stability, is determined. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital divide; Digital economy; Digital transformations; Financial innovation; Financial regulation and supervision; Financial services; Financial stability; FinTech; RegTech; Technological innovation",,,,,,"Kaczor, S., Kryvinska, N., (2013) It is All about services—fundamentals, Drivers, and Business Models.

As a result, firms have used cellular phones, the Internet, and digital currencies to facilitate exchanges and operate their businesses. This course of action affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The goal of the present study is to examine the role that fintech plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. First, we analyse the income velocity and the money multiplier during pre-fintech and post-fintech periods. The results confirm that there is no change in income velocity and the money multiplier during these periods. Second, we develop the money demand function to examine the effect of monetary policy and demonstrate that low monetary policy rates lead to an increase in money demand. When we introduce fintech components to examine their impact on money demand, we find that mobile and Internet technologies and all digital currencies considered in this study are robust predictors of money demand. Third, we analyse the product market equation and report that after the initiation of fintech, monetary policy has a significant effect. To examine the cost function, we incorporate fintech components and identify that cellular phones, Internet technology, Litecoin, and Ethereum are the determinants of the output gap. Finally, we examine the drivers of fintech and determine that the real interest rate, GDP, inflation, the financial development index, and stock market indices are significant determinants of fintech. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",,,,,,,"Arize, A.C., Effects of financial innovations on the money demand function: Evidence from Japan (1990) International Economic Journal, 4, pp. 59-70; Arrau, P., De Gregorio, J., Financial innovation and money demand: Application to Chile and Mexico (1993) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 75, pp. 524-530; Bernanke, B.S., Blinder, A.S., Credit, money, aggregate demand (1988) The American Economic Review, 78, pp. 435-439; Braun, B., Speaking to the people?

Findings: FinTech is a specific type of Financial Technology, defined as technology used to provide financial markets a financial product or financial service, characterized by sophisticated technology relative to existing technology in that market. Firms that primarily use FinTech are classified as FinTech firms. Using these definitions, the paper provides a structure for the FinTech industry, classifying each type of FinTech firm by FinTech characteristics. Research limitations/implications: Research that would inform the economic importance of FinTech would be served with an increased understanding of FinTech firms and the FinTech industry.

Therefore, we conducted an in-depth interview with 15scholars and Fintech specialists from different Gulf universities (i.e. from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Oman). In addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of Fintech; and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities. Websites on the financial departments of universities in the GCC, data from the national education Ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.The findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the GCC is included in the top 10 leaders in Fintech/crypto education. Despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the GCC have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the Fintech sector. Furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field. Approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology. We conclude that each educated individual in the GCC has to think about Fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future. Further, the blockchain technology may assist us with changing the connections among schools, colleges, universities and, thusly, their relationship to society. © 2019 SERSC.","Blockchain; Finance; Financial Technology; Fintech Education; GCC; Higher Education",,,,,,"Abdeldayem Marwan, M., Teaching Philosophy and Learning Support in Higher Education as inspired from the Senior Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy, UK: A Case Study from Bahrain (2018) Social Science Learning Education Journal, 3 (6), pp. 77-84; Abdeldayem Marwan, M., Aldulaimi, S.H., Cryptocurrency in the GCC Economy (2020) International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 10 (1); Abdeldayem Marwan, M., Saeed, A., B) Trends and opportunities of artificial intelligence in human resource management: Aspirations for public sector in Bahrain (2020) International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9 (1), pp. 3867-3871; Abdeldayem Marwan, M., Saeed, A., Lessons Drawn From Privatisation in Developing Countries: Evidence From An Emerging Economy (2020) .

We synthesize the insights it provides into two domains: credit supply and payment and clearing services. The rise of FinTech has introduced digital transformation of the “bricks-and-mortar” banking model and dramatically changed the way financial services are delivered.

Islamic banks in Malaysia specifically have been on forefront in bringing FinTech into their processes at very early stage. Customers usually do not choose Islamic banks for technology but this paper will analyse the impact of FinTech in retaining customers. A 26-item questionnaire was used to gather data from 325 customers of selected banks in Malaysia by strata sampling. Statistical data was analysed through various tests like reliability analysis, sample adequacy, factor analysis and regression analysis using SPSS 25.0. The findings of the study revealed that payments, advisory and compliance services of the FinTech has an impact on the retention of customers while financing service which is treated as important part in conventional banking has no significance on customer retention. This study will help Islamic banks to customise FinTech services for their customers and have association with such FinTech companies which adds value to their financial services.

Using detailed data on the almost 1000 fintech startups in France to date, we find that most fintechs are geographically clustered and that the location of new fintech startups is affected, among other things, by the size of clusters and the presence of incubators. Larger clusters attract more new fintech startups, and incubators are shown to be an effective mechanism to attract new fintech startups. We further examine entrepreneurial exits of fintechs and find that being located in a larger cluster reduces the risk of failure but increases the likelihood of being acquired. Increased competition within a given segment of fintech increases failure rates. Moreover, the risk of failure is significantly lower for fintech startups that have been developed in an incubator. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cluster; Entrepreneurship; Fintech",,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Stam, E., Audretsch, D.B., O’Connor, A., The lineages of the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach (2017) Small Business Economics, 49 (1), pp. 1-10; Ahlers, G.K., Cumming, D., Günther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding (2015) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39 (4), pp. 955-980; Armour, J., Cumming, D., The legislative road to Silicon Valley (2006) Oxford Economic Papers, 58, pp. 596-635; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: a new post-crisis paradigm?

Indian Government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'Digital Drive-, which was partially successful. But still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system. Presently to support farmer technologically Agri- tech is providing services. Fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities. So the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs. But due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths. The aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in Agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens. This helps farmers to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","Agri-Tech; Agriculture sector; Fin- tech; Financial services; Technological challenges",,,,,,"Gupta, A., Enabling business of agriculture via new financing technologies (2018) Journal of Agriculture and Allied Sciences, , July; Gandhi, V.P., Growth and transformation of the agribusiness sector: Drivers, models and challenges (2014) Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics; Kumar, D., Agriculture credit reform and financial inclusion in India (2014) International Journal of Business Quantitative Economic Applied Management Research, , September; Solanki, R., A study of agricultural finance by commercialbanks in India: A case study of Central Bank of India (2016) Abhinav National Monthly Refereed Journal of Research in Commerce & Management; https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305564; https://nextbillion.net/can-next-generation-startups-unite-agritech-and-fintech-for-farmers-in-emerging-markets/; https://agfundernews.com/agtech-startups-fintech.html/; https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/india-crops-agriculture-radha-mohan-singh-4389510/; https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/15610/5-ways-the-fintech-industry-will-support-farming; https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/banks-fund-agricultural-technology-companies-for-rural-lending-118060900031_1.html; https://unitus.vc/updates/can-fintech-entrepreneurs-save-indias-farmers/; https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/economic-survey-emphasis-on-women-farmers-for-rural-transformation/articleshow/62693042.cms; https://enam.gov.in/; http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/rap/files/uploads/ESF_Presentations/E-Agriculture_Strategy.pdf; Ari Kristina, S., Permitasari, N.P.A.L., Knowledge, attitudes and barriers towards human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in developing economies countries of South-East Asia region: A systematic review (2019) Systematic Reviews in Pharmacy, 10 (1), pp. 81-86. , Print; Zhang, W., Liu, H., Al-Shabrawey, M., Caldwell, R., Caldwell, R., Inflammation and diabetic retinal microvascular complications (2011) Journal of Cardiovascular Disease Research, 2 (2), pp. 96-103",,,,"Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

China's rapid expansion of Fintech in the past decade has significantly improved the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for formerly financially excluded population groups. Linking the index of digital financial inclusion with China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data, we find that Fintech development is positively correlated with household income, and the positive effect is larger for rural households than the urban counterpart, suggesting that Fintech development has helped narrow the urban-rural income gap. Moreover, the poor gain more than the rich from Fintech development in rural China, indicating its benign distributive impacts within rural China. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","China; Fintech; growth; inequality",,,,,,"Bazot, G., (2013) Financial Consumption and the Cost of Finance: Measuring Financial Efficiency in Europe (1950-2007)., , Working Paper, Paris School of Economics; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Martinez Peria, M.S., Reaching out: Access to and use of banking services across countries (2007) Journal of Financial Economics, 85 (1), pp. 234-266; Bianchi, M., Credit constraints, entrepreneurial talent, and economic development (2010) Small Business Economics, 34 (1), pp. 93-104; Chattopadhyay, S.K., (2011) Financial Inclusion in India: A Case-study of West Bengal., , Reserve Bank of India Working Paper; (2016) Blue Book of China's Bank Card Industry Development., , http://www.isc.org.cn/zxzx/xhdt/listinfo-36846.html, China Bank Association; Demirguc-Kunt, A., Klapper, L., (2012) Measuring Financial Inclusion: The Global Findex Database., , http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/453121468331738740/Measuring-financial-inclusion-the-Global-Findex-Database, Policy Research Working Paper Series, No. 6025; Evans, D.S., Jovanovic, B., An estimated model of entrepreneurial choice under liquidity constraints (1989) Journal of Political Economy, 97, pp. 808-827; Guo, F., Kong, T., Wang, J., Zhang, X., Cheng, Z., Ruan, F., Sun, T., Wang, F., (2016) The Construction of Digital Financial Inclusion Index in China (in Chinese)., , Institute of Digital Finance Working Paper, Peking University; Kapoor, A., Financial inclusion and the future of the Indian economy (2013) Futures, 10, pp. 35-42; Karaivanov, A., Financial constraints and occupational choice in Thai villages (2012) Journal of Development Economics, 97 (2), pp. 201-220; Nykvist, J., Entrepreneurship and liquidity constraints: Evidence from Sweden (2008) Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 110 (1), pp. 23-43; (2016) The FinTech Opportunity., , https://www.nber.org/papers/w22476, Philippon NBER Workig Paper, No. 22476; Piketty, T., (2014) Capital in the 21st Century., , Cambridge: Harvard University; Stock, J., Yogo, M., Wright, J., A survey of weak instruments and weak identification in generalized method of moments (2002) Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 20 (4), pp. 518-529; Wan, G., Understanding regional poverty and inequality trends in China: Methodological issues and empirical findings (2007) Review of Income and Wealth, 53 (1), pp. 25-34; Wan, G., (2008) Inequality and Growth in Modern China., , Oxford University Press; Wan, G., (2008) Understanding Inequality and Poverty in China: Methods and Applications., , Palgrave Macmillan; Wan, G., Zhang, X., (2015) Who Gains More from Which Infrastructure in Rural People's Republic of China?, , https://www.adb.org/publications/who-gains-more-which-infrastructure-rural-prc, ADBI Working Paper, No. 540; Wang, C., Wan, G., Yang, D., Income inequality in the People's Republic of China: Trends, determinants, and proposed remedies (2014) Journal of Economic Surveys, 28 (4), pp. 686-708","Luo, Z.; Center for Economic Development Research, Wuhan UniversityChina; email: luozhi@whu.edu.cn",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: This study engages qualitative methods. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of Islamic fintech. Further, the existing literature of SDGs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in Indonesia. Following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of Islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition. The selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the SDGs. Finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of Indonesia in implementing SDGs. Findings: This work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute Islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community. In some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms’ effort in promoting SDG of ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and reducing the inequalities (SDG 10). Research limitations/implications: The discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used. Practical implications: The Indonesian Government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in SDG 15 (life on land). Social implications: This work elaborates in what way the Islamic fintech lending has been promoting the SDGs in Indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in Indonesia. Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of Islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of SDGs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia;

One way to handle those is to adopt a streaming setting where data is only available to the algorithms during a very short time. When a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after. Especially, ongoing globalisation efforts in FinTech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10,000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence. This paper investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: K-means and FADO. Especially, this manuscript provides supports for the claim that &#x2018;the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance&#x2019;. To support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of AML detection in realtime payment systems. We focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive FADO assuming a single cluster, and the well-known K- means algorithm working with K &gt; 1 clusters. We find - in this case - that the use of K-means with multiple clusters is unfavourable as (1) both tuning for K, as well as the need for additional complexity in the K- means algorithm challenges the computational constraints; (2) K-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results; (3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections; (4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome. This makes in the presented case FADO favourable over K-means (with K &gt; 1).

As a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain. The term 'FinTech' is one such terminology. This term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector. These operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using Information Technology based applications. The term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc. This is important to note that the development of FinTech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc. However, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users. In an effort to secure FinTech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of FinTech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues. It provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for FinTech. Finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber security; FinTech; fraud detection; Internet of Things; privacy; security; threats","Crime; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Internet of things; Mobile cloud computing; Network security; Surveys; Comprehensive analysis; Cyber security; Fraud detection; security; Security and privacy issues; State-of-the-art technology; Technology based applications; threats; Fintech",,,,,"Zhang, Y., Yu, R., Xie, S., Yao, W., Xiao, Y., Guizani, M., Home M2M networks: Architectures, standards, and QoS improvement (2011) IEEE Commun.

Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets. 'It is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change. The certainties of yesterday are the doubts of today, and the folly and mockery of tomorrow. Every problem we solve only reveals a dozen more of increasing complexity.'1 © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.","Artificial intelligence; Fintech; Insurtech; Invest-tech; Machine learning; Proptech; Regtech",,,,,,"Kennedy, R.F., (1966) Speech held at Stellenbosch University South Africa, , https://rfkhumanrights.org/legacy/speeches/stellenbosch-university-south-africa-june-7th-1966, (7 June), (call-off date for all hyperlinks, unless stated otherwise: 10 July 2019); Direct Supervisory Powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in the Realm of Credit Rating Agencies-Some Critical Observations in a Broader Context (2018) European Business law review, 29, pp. 169 and 170. , et seq; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/search.html?qid=1562489876104&text=FinTech&scope=EURLEX&type=quick&lang=en&DTS_SUBDOM=Legislation; Armstrong, P., Financial Technology: ESMA's Approach (2018) 4th luxembourg Fintech Conference, , speech held at the, ESMA71-99-1051, 1 et seq.

To address this gap, this paper aims to understand the evolution of the FinTechs ecosystem, through a socio-technical system theory and service innovation lense. A case study research methodology was used, in which 6 Brazilian and 5 Portuguese FinTechs were analyzed. Primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with managers and employees of the startups, while secondary data was obtained through the analysis of reports from consulting firms and public relations materials of the startups. Results show the evolution of FinTech ecosystems from the perspective of socio-technical system theory and service innovation. From the socio-technical system perspective it was possible to understand the roles of social, technological and organizational actors in the evolution of these ecosystems. From the service innovation perspective, it was possible to understand the dynamics of the evolution of the FinTech ecosystems and its results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","FinTech; FinTech ecosystem; Process innovation; Service innovation; Social-technical theory","Fintech; Human resource management; Public relations; System theory; Case study research; Ecosystem evolution; Organizational actors; Process Innovation; Semi structured interviews; Service innovation; Social-technical theory; Sociotechnical systems; Ecosystems",,,,,"Puschmann, T., Fintech (2017) Bus.

We emphasize that shadow banks provide higher but riskier returns and such characteristics affect the stability of shadow deposits. In our setting, the stability of shadow deposits is influenced by two offsetting effects, namely: the patience effect, which makes investors more willing to wait because of the potentially higher returns; and the uncertainty effect, which makes investors more likely to withdraw as a result of higher risk. Under liberalized interest rates, the patience effect will erode and the uncertainty effect will be heightened because the post-liberalization higher return of traditional banks undermines the importance of the extra return of shadow deposits to depositors, while preserving the importance of the risk aspect. Fintech development is modeled as a reduction in the withdrawal cost that facilitates runs. This affects the stability of shadow deposits because of their wider fintech reliance. Regulators should be cautious in pushing interest rate liberalization and fintech application alongside building a safety net for shadow banking. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","bank run; E26; E422; fintech; G18; interest rate liberalization; shadow banking",,,,,,"Acharya, V.V., Cooley, T.F., Richardson, M.P., Walter, I., Manufacturing tail risk: A perspective on the financial crisis of 2007–09 (2010) Foundations and Trends in Finance, 4 (4), pp. 247-325; Adrian, T., Ashcraft, A.B., (2012) Staff Report, , “Shadow banking A review of the literature,”, 580, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, NY; Bakk-Simon, K., Borgioli, S., Giron, C., (2011) ECB Occasional Paper, , “Shadow banking in the Euro area An overview,”, 133, European Central Bank, Frankfurt; Borst, N., (2013) Policy Brief, , “Shadow deposits as a source of financial instability Lessons from the American experience for China,”, PB13–14, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC; Brunnermeier, M.K., Deciphering the liquidity and credit crunch 2007–2008 (2009) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23 (1), pp. 77-100; Buchak, G., Matvos, G., Piskorski, T., Seru, A., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) Journal of Financial Economics, 130 (3), pp. 453-483; Caballero, R.J., Hoshi, T., Kashyap, A.K., Zombie lending and depressed restructuring in Japan (2008) American Economic Review, 98 (5), pp. 1943-1977; Chan, S., Ji, Y., (2019) Working Paper, , “Fintech, interest rate liberalization and runs on shadow deposits,”, 20119-07-09a, Xiamen University, Xiamen; Cho, Y.J., The effect of financial liberalization on the efficiency of credit allocation: Some evidence from Korea (1988) Journal of Development Economics, 29 (1), pp. 101-110; Ehlers, T., Kong, S., Zhu, F., (2018) BIS Working Paper, , “Mapping shadow banking in China Structure and dynamics,”, 701, Bank for International Settlements, Basel; Feyzioglu, T., Porter, N., Takats, E., (2009) IMF Working Paper, , “Interest rate liberalization in China,”, 09/171, International Monetary Fund, Washington DC; (2015) Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report 2015, , https://www.fsb.org/2015/11/global-shadow-banking-monitoring-report-2015/, [online; cited 19 November 2019].

However, fintech development can help to improve the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for sections of the population formerly excluded from such services. Improved access is expected to stimulate the growth essential for promoting urbanization, possibly alleviating the negative impacts of a digital divide and creating a trickle-down effect. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of fintech development on urbanization, as indicated by labor transfer from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors in China. It is found that: (i) the digital divide hindered, while fintech development contributed to urbanization; (ii) the positive effect of fintech development on urbanization affects individuals both with and without access to the internet, yielding the so-called trickle-down effect and thus helping to alleviate the negative consequences of a digital divide; and (iii) regarding transmission mechanisms, fintech development helps to generate additional jobs and raise income in non-agricultural sectors, stimulating urbanization even for those without access to the internet. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","D14; D31; digital divide; fintech; labor transfer; R58; urbanization",,,,,,"Bazot, G., Financial consumption and the cost of finance: Measuring financial efficiency in Europe (1950–2007) (2018) Journal of the European Economic Association, 16 (1), pp. 123-160; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Peria, M.S.M., Reaching out: Access to and use of banking services across countries (2007) Journal of Financial Economics, 85 (1), pp. 234-266; Chattopadhyay, S.K., (2011) Working Paper, , “Financial inclusion in India A case-study of West Bengal,”, Reserve Bank of India, New Delhi; Chen, C., Wu, Y., Impact of foreign direct investment and export on urbanization: Evidence from China (2017) China & World Economy, 25 (1), pp. 71-89; (2019) China Internet Development Report, , http://www.isc.org.cn/zxzx/xhdt/listinfo-36846.html, [online; cited November 2019].

Fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to ‘big banks’, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor. For many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in Kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid. While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the Global North to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. Through fintech, private citizens and groups in the Global North are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. While fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans. This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion. In so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation. © The Author(s) 2020.","Fintech; Kenya; migration; neoliberalism; race; refugees",,,,,,"Anzilotti, E., (2017), (,) Refugee camps are turning into permanent cities – can they be smart cities?, 17 July, 7; Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition and Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Bauman, Z., (2004) Wasted Lives: Modernity and Its Outcasts, , 1st ed, Cambridge, Polity Press; Betts, A., Geervliet, R., MacPherson, C., (2018), (,) Self-reliance Kalobeyei?

Internal governance issues of P2P lending platforms are further discussed according to the model results. A positive U-shaped relationship has been found between the platform duration and its net cash inflow rate which proves the role of reputation in the long-term development of P2P lending platforms. In addition, we demonstrate that both capital and operational structure design of the platform (e.g. shareholders background, credit assignment, trusteeship and guarantee) have a significant impact on the platform’s net cash inflow rate. The cash flow level of the platform has also been affected by the regional FinTech ecosystem. Platforms in a medium-developing ecosystem may have the highest net cash inflow rate, while a backward ecosystem will lower the cash flows of the platforms located in this area on average. Some suggestions on cash flow management and internal governance of P2P lending platforms for both platform founders and governments are put forward in the end of the study. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cash flow; Ecosystem; P2P lending; Reputation; Structure design",,,,,,"Philippon, T., (2016) The FinTech opportunity, , National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge; Huang, R.H., Online P2P lending and regulatory responses in China: Opportunities and challenges (2018) European Business Organization Law Review, 19 (1), pp. 63-92; Hulme, M.K., Wright, C., Internet based social lending: Past, present and future (2006) Social Futures Observatory, 11, pp. 1-115; Meyer, T., Heng, S., Kaiser, S., Online P2P lending nibbles at banks’ loan business (2007) Deutsche Bank Research, 2 (1), pp. 39-65; Milne, A., Parboteeah, P., (2016) The business models and economics of peer-to-peer lending, , http://aei.pitt.edu/76108/1/ECRI_RR17_P2P_Lending.pdf, European Credit Research Institute (ECRI), Research 17.

Regression tests need to be applied at that application after migration or version update are required to get written again in order to resolve compatibility issues with the new technologies. A problematic scenario occurs for the automation of script-level test when an application is updated or migrated just to include the technology which is not supported by the tool in use of testing. In this case, the purpose of test automation is eradicated because the scripts for regression testing are rewritten with the scripting language of the new testing tool being utilized. In this paper, a Model-Driven Approach is presented to develop the automated testing scripts for the validation of the FinTech Web Applications. A Meta-Model is proposed that depicts the scenario of regression testing of a FinTech system.

The survey also highlighted private investment as a catalyst to propel growth and achieve higher levels of employment and domestic savings. The available data shows that currently the domestic savings to GDP stands at 30.5% of which 29.2% is channelized into various investment avenues. Although this is a fairly good rate, it is much less compared to 45% domestic savings in China of which 44.6% flow into investment avenues. Hence it is essential not only to stimulate high rate of savings but also make sure that they find their way into productive channels of investment to bring about 8% growth rate to begin with and move towards a double digit growth in the next couple of years. The household savings have declined from over 15% in 2016-17 to 12% in 2018-19 but, the rate of investments accounted for more than 85% of the savings. © 2019 SERSC.",,,,,,,"Berk, J.B., Green, R.C., Mutual fund flows and performance in rational markets (2004) Journal of Political Economy, 112 (6), pp. 1269-1295; Cohen, L., Frazzini, A., Malloy, C., The small world of investing: Board connections and mutual fund returns (2008) Journal of Political Economy, 116 (5), pp. 951-979; Khorana, A., Servaes, H., Tufano, P., Mutual fund fees around the world (2008) The Review of Financial Studies, 22 (3), pp. 1279-1310; Utz, S., Wimmer, M., Are they any good at all?

The Internet of things will be a new normal, dedicated to unlocking human potentials. The purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibilities and challenges of the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries. To this end, a survey was conducted on a sample of 60 small and medium industries. It was revealed that the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries did not seem ready to be achieved due to the limitations in technology infrastructure, data and information, human resources and policy. Therefore, improvement to these factors should be made to realize the human-centered and technology-based society. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data and information; Financial capital; Human potential; Technology infrastructure; Technology-based; Physics",,,,,"Buchak, G., Matvos, G., Piskorski, T., Seru, A., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) J.

Second, it exploits human rights to security, privacy and truthful reportage without seriously regulated or legislated accountability. Third, social media–the main offender–takes prodigious profits at huge social cost, by facilitating the grooming of terrorists, vulnerable persons and enabling varieties of criminality; it feloniously steals private property, notably human identities for advertising revenue; and it facilitates dissemination of fake news, research and propaganda.

FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"agroindustry; capacity building; developing world; digitization; infrastructural development; natural resource; profitability; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off",,,,,"United Nations, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015), https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf, URL:; Campbell, B.M., Beare, D.J., Bennett, E.M., Hall-Spencer, J.M., Ingram, J.S., Jaramillo, F., Ortiz, R., Shindell, D., Agriculture production as a major driver of the earth system exceeding planetary boundaries (2017) Ecol Soc, 22; Rippke, U., Ramirez-Villegas, J., Jarvis, A., Vermeulen, S.J., Parker, L., Mer, F., Diekkrüger, B., Howden, M., Timescales of transformational climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African agriculture (2016) Nat Clim Change, 6, p. 605; Christiaensen, L., Demery, L., Kuhl, J., The (Evolving) Role of Agriculture in Poverty Reduction: an Empirical Perspective (2010), UNU-WIDER Working Paper #2010/36; Foley, J.A., DeFries, R., Asner, G.P., Barford, C., Bonan, G., Carpenter, S.R., Chapin, F.S., Helkowski, J.H., Global consequences of land use (2005) Science, 309, pp. 570-574; IPCC, Mitigation of climate change (2014) Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf, URL:; Nilsson, M., Griggs, D., Visbeck, M., Policy: map the interactions between sustainable development goals (2016) Nat News, 534, p. 320; Hosonuma, N., Herold, M., De Sy, V., De Fries, R.S., Brockhaus, M., Verchot, L., Angelsen, A., Romijn, E., An assessment of deforestation and forest degradation drivers in developing countries (2012) Environ Res Lett, 7; Herrmann, R., Jumbe, C., Bruentrup, M., Osabuohien, E., Competition between biofuel feedstock and food production: empirical evidence from sugarcane outgrower settings in Malawi (2018) Biomass Bioenergy, 114, pp. 100-111; Delzeit, R., Zabel, F., Meyer, C., Václavík, T., Addressing future trade-offs between biodiversity and cropland expansion to improve food security (2017) Reg Environ Change, 17, pp. 1429-1441; Bonsch, M., Humpenöder, F., Popp, A., Bodirsky, B., Dietrich, J.P., Rolinski, S., Biewald, A., Stevanovic, M., Trade-offs between land and water requirements for large‐scale bioenergy production (2016) Gcb Bioenergy, 8, pp. 11-24; Campbell, B.M., Hansen, J.W., Rioux, J., Stirling, C., Twomlow, S., Wollenberg, E., Urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG 13): transforming agriculture and food systems (2018) Curr Opin Environ Sustainability, 34, pp. 13-20; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of Fintech: a new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Geo J Int'l L, 47, p. 1271; Manyika, J., Lund, S., Singer, M., White, O., Berry, C., Digital Finance for all: Powering Inclusive Growth in Emerging Economies (2016), McKinsey Global Institute; Gabor, D., Brooks, S., The digital revolution in financial inclusion: international development in the fintech era (2017) New Polit Econ, 22, pp. 423-436; Jenik, I., Lauer, K., Regulatory Sandboxes and Financial Inclusion (2017), CGAP Washington, DC; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Leora, K., Dorothe, S., Saniya, A., Jake, H., The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the FinTech Revolution (2018), World Bank Washington, DC The authors give an up-to-date description of why financial inclusion matters for development.

Due to the wide adoption of IT, various FinTech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services. Traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations. As a result, there is a need to enhance the security of FinTech authentication against cyber-criminals. As an alternative, graphical passwords (GPs) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems. In the literature, various GP schemes were proposed such as PassPoints, DAS, Cued Click Points, GeoPass, etc. In this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most GP schemes, and thus design RouteMap, a map-and route-based GP to further improve the security of FinTech applications. This scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials. In the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (FinTech) background, and investigated the performance of RouteMap by comparing it with two similar schemes. Our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using RouteMap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory. Our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on the combination of GP and FinTech. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","FinTech application; Graphical passwords; Map passwords; Multiple password inference; Security and usability; User authentication","Finance; Maps; Authentication mechanisms; Financial industry; Graphical password; Multiple password inference; Password-based systems; Process information; Security and usabilities; User authentication; Authentication",,,,,"Gai, K., Qiu, M., Sun, X., A survey on FinTech (2018) J.

This Study used descriptive methods and gathering information / data via the internet. FinTech was created to implement technology in the financial sector. The results of his research, namely FinTech, could hamper the development of banking, but could also be an opportunity for the banking sector itself. From these results, it was said that banks could be digitized because of the encouragement of FinTech. This is due to FinTech taking a large part of the banking industry's market share. Of course, FinTech can be a threat as well as an opportunity for national financial institutions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Competition; Banking industry; Banking sectors; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Large parts; Market share; Finance",,,,,"Freedman, R.S., (2006) Introduction to Financial Technology, , Elsevier; Soegoto, E.S., (2014) Entrepreneurship, p. 538. , Jakarta: PT Elex Media Komputindo; Bodie, Z., Merton, R.C., (1995) Financial Infrastructure and Public Policy: A Functional Perspective, , Available at SSRN 6639; Bouman, F.J.A., The rosca: Financial technology of an informal savings and credit institution in developing economies/l'arec: La technologie financière d'une institution informelle d'épargne et de crédit dans les économies en développement (1979) Savings and Development, pp. 253-276; Zahra, S.A., Technology strategy and financial performance: Examining the moderating role of the firm's competitive environment (1996) Journal of Business Venturing, 11 (3), pp. 189-219; McCann, J.E., Patterns of growth, competitive technology, and financial strategies in young ventures (1991) Journal of Business Venturing, 63, pp. 189-208; Wardiana, W., (2002) Perkembangan Teknologi Informasi di Indonesia; Lyman, T.R., Pickens, M., Porteous, D., (2008) Regulating Transformational Branchless Banking: Mobile Phones and Other Technology to Increase Access to Finance; Mishkin, F.S., Strahan, P.E., What will technology do to financial structure?

Design/methodology/approach: Ten countries from both financial systems have been selected based on the presence of Islamic finance and conventional finance in the country. Data was analyzed from year 2011 to 2017 and keeping the former as base year to measure the change in the population fraction. Findings: The findings found that Islamic finance countries are more inclusive in terms of financial inclusion and women are financially more empowered as compared to the counterpart. On the contrary, countries with conventional finance have a higher number of FinTech users. Research limitations/implications: The difference between the performances of two systems in terms of financial inclusion is relatively small; therefore, future studies should incorporate more indicators for financial inclusion. Originality/value: This study will be useful for understanding the nature of both financial systems, and the further research can be done to find the determinants of financial inclusion. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Conventional finance; Finance; Financial inclusion; Findex; FinTech; Islamic finance",,,,,,"Alaa Alaabed, F., Mirakhor, A., Accelerating risk sharing finance via FinTech, NextGen Islamic finance (2017) The 1st International Colloquium on Islamic banking and Finance, pp. 1-10; Allen, F., Carletti, E., Cull, R., Qian, J., Senbet, L., Valenzuela, P., (2013) Resolving the African Financial Development Gap: Cross-Country Comparisons and a within-Country Study of Kenya, , The World Bank, University of Chicago Press, Washington, DC; Allen, F., DemirgücKunt, A., Klapper, L., Peria, M.S.M., The foundations of financial inclusion: understanding ownership and use of formal accounts (2016) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 27 (1), pp. 1-30; Al-Shami, S.S.A., Majid, I., Mohamad, M.R., Rashid, N., Household welfare and women empowerment through microcredit financing: evidence from Malaysia microcredit (2017) Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 27 (8), pp. 894-910; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: a new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Geo.

In this study, based on the weighted least squares (WLS) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of FinTech development on agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality. Our results show that there is an inverted “U” shape relationship between the development of FinTech and agricultural NPS pollution. That is, after crossing a “threshold value”, the level of FinTech development can curb agricultural NPS pollution. At the structural level, the availability of FinTech services, the FinTech infrastructure, and the agricultural NPS pollution also have an inverted “U” shape relationship. At the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of FinTech development, the use of FinTech services, the availability of FinTech services, and the FinTech infrastructure have an inverted “U” shape relationship with agricultural NPS pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of FinTech development and its structure on agricultural NPS pollution is insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FinTech development can help reduce agricultural NPS pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a “U” shape relationship always exists between FinTech service quality and agricultural NPS pollution, the quality of FinTech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural NPS pollution more effectively. © 2019 by the authors.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking",,,,,,"Adhami, S., Giudici, G., Martinazzi, S., Why do businesses go crypto?

This article thus sets out to gain insights into the interplay and overall role of societal VPs as potential antecedents and change catalysts in the formation of the often promised disruptive potential of fintechs for the financial sector. In an inductive, theory-building approach, the authors first examine how societal VPs transcend individual functional and emotional ones for entrepreneurs, and conclude with a conceptual model of how the former can build up the disruptive potential of fintechs and deliver apt solutions for entrepreneurs seeking finance. © The Author(s) 2019.","disruption; entrepreneurial finance; fintechs; societal value; value propositions",,,,,,"Almquist, E., Cleghorn, J., Sherer, L., The B2B elements of value (2018) Harvard Business Review, 2018, pp. 72-81; Almquist, E., Senior, J., Block, N., The elements of value (2016) Harvard Business Review, 2016, pp. 46-53; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J.A., Van Rossum, W., Customer value propositions in business markets (2006) Harvard Business Review, 2006 (Reprint R0603F), pp. 1-10; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The evolution of fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm?, , University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research, Paper No. 2015/047; Atiase, V.Y., Wang, Y., Mahmood, S., FNGOs and financial inclusion: investigating the impact of microcredit on employment growth in Ghana (2019) The International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, 20, pp. 90-106; Baldwin, C.Y., Woodard, C.J., The architecture of platforms: A unified view (2008) Harvard Business School Working Paper Series, pp. 9-34; Ballantyne, D., Frow, P., Varey, R.J., Value propositions as communication practice: taking a wider view (2011) Industrial Marketing Management, 40, pp. 202-210; Baptista, G., Oliveira, T., Why so serious?

Users choosing the Fintech application generally consider convenience, security, transaction suitability, convenience, and cashback. The problem is that the user's trust in Fintech is still in doubt. Currently the application provides reviews to share their experiences. With the number of reviews displayed, it needs analysis that can classify the review into positive or negative classes. This research is using experimental method. Data is taken from Google Play in the OVO Application. The method used is the method of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Data processing is using the Application RapidMiner Studio 7.6.003. The result is that the Ovo application gets the best value with an accuracy of 82.33%. So that it can be concluded that the results of the review might convince users of other positive customer experiences while negative experiences can be used as a contribution to the thinking of the next product development to be better so they can compete. © 2019 IEEE.","fintech; PSO; review; SVM","Data handling; Fintech; Reviews; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Best value; Customer experience; Experimental methods; Google plays; Needs analysis; Negative experiences; Particle swarm optimization method; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,"(2017) Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , Anoname, Jakarta; Ananta, Y., (2019) Ada 150 Juta Pengguna Internet OJK Dorong Peran Fintech, , http://www.cnbcindonesia.com/fintech/20190310101921-37-59704/ada-150-juta-pengguna-internet-ojk-dorong-peran-fintech, CNBC Indonesia, [Online]., [Accessed: 21-May-2019]; Rahmayani, I., Indonesia raksasa teknologi digital asia (2015) Kementrian Komunikasi Dan Informatika Republik Indonesia, , http://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/6095/indonesia-raksasateknologi-digital-asia/0/sorotanmedia, [Online]., [Accessed: 03-May-2019]; Klein, A., The coming 'fintech' revolution (2016) Democracy Journal, , http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/42/the-coming-fintechrevolution, [Online]., [Accessed: 03-May-2019]; Luckandi, D., (2018) Analisis Transaksi Pembayaran Menggunakan Fintech Pada UMKM di Indonesia : Pendekatan Adaptive Structuration Theory, , Universitas Islam Indonesia; Khafiyah, N.N., (2019) Pengaruh Persepsi Mahasiswa Mengenai Uang Elektronik Terhadap Minat Menggunakan Aplikasi OVO, , Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah; Bates, R., (2017) Banking on the Future : An Exploration of Fintech and the Consumer Interest; Saksonova, S., Kuzmina-Merlino, I., Fintech as financial innovation-the possibilities and problems of implementation (2017) Eur.

This paper presents a comparison of sentiment classification performance using machine learning techniques consisting of the Naïve Bayes classifier and support vector machine (SVM) to provide a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment in Thai FinTech news and opinions on the tweet corpus. Accordingly, machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze how tweets correlate with stock market price behavior. Finally, the actual and prediction errors are examined by evaluating classifier performance.

The adoption of this technology by FinTech companies constitutes the next step towards the expansion of blockchain and its sustainability. The paper conducts a mapping study on the research topics, limitations, gaps and future trends of blockchain in FinTech companies. A total of 49 papers from a scientific database (Web of Science Core Collection) have been analyzed. The results show a deep focus in challenges such as security, scalability, legal and regulatory, privacy or latency, with proposed solutions still to be far from being effective. A vast majority of the research is focused into finance and banking sector, obviating other industries that could play a crucial role in the further expansion of blockchain. This study can contribute to researchers as a starting point for their investigation, as well as a source for recommendations on future investigation directions regarding blockchain in the FinTech sector. © 2019 by the authors.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; FinTech; Mapping study; Technological challenges","banking; mapping method; sustainability; technological development",,,,,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, accessed on 25 February 2019; Tschorsch, F., Scheuermann, B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies (2015) IEEE Commun.

However, relevant studies are rare and there is no consensus on the optimal indicator system for sustainable development. Therefore, this study proposes an indicator system to evaluate sustainability and conducts in-depth analysis of the relationship between FinTech and sustainable development based on data of peer-to-peer platforms (P2P) in 31 Chinese provinces. The empirical results show the existence of a U-shaped relationship between FinTech and sustainable development, mainly determined by the pattern of extensive economic growth. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are significant regional differences in its impact on sustainable development, being significant in China's eastern and central regions and insignificant in the western region; moreover, the impact on the central region is significantly higher than that on the eastern region. Our research not only has strong practical significance but also contributes significantly to the literature on FinTech and sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumption emission; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Financial technology; Peer-to-peer; Social development; Sustainable development","economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental legislation; financial system; heterogeneity; literature review; optimization; social development; sustainability; sustainable development; China",,,,,"Caiado, R., Nascimento, D., Quelhas, O., Tortorella, G., Rangel, L., Towards sustainability through green, lean and six sigma integration at service industry: Review and framework (2018) Technol.

This term covers a large range of techniques, from data security to financial service. Specially, user privacy protection is generally considered one of the most significant aspects in the financial security domain and preserving data carrying privacy is a critical task in producing a privacy protection strategy, e.g., one of the crucial issues in mobile finance is to ensure the legitimate mobile device users can efficiently search inclusive information from servers without leaking the user privacy. More precisely, more and more mobile finance APP(e.g., AliPay, China Unionpay Quick Pass) has the auxiliary tool or third-party services function that enable users make a location-based services(LBS) query, while the LBS usually carry users’ location privacy and that data of service providers should be accessed by legitimate users. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving LBS framework which supports the query area is a square area based on the user's location, and achieves fine-grained access control on the financial service provider data, user's privacy(especially location privacy), confidentiality of the service provider data, and accurate query result. More precisely, our framework also uses redundant point-of-interesting(POI) records to protect privacy against LBS provider(LBSP), but employs a semi-trusted third party(called proxy) to filter out redundant POI records. We propose a novel blind filter protocol based on comparable attribute-based encryption(CABE) and “transformation” technique, which can filter out the encrypted POI records under the condition that both LBSP and proxy without knowing the user's location information. In comparison with existing solutions, our framework not only realize access control on service provider data innately, but also incurs lower communication and computation overhead on the user side. The analysis and the experiments indicate that our framework is secure and efficient for mobile devices in terms of computation and the communication overhead. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","0-encoding; 1-encoding; Access control; Attribute-based encryption; FinTech; LBS; Location privacy; Privacy-preserving","Access control; Cryptography; Data privacy; Finance; Location; Mobile security; Telecommunication services; 0-encoding; 1-encoding; Attribute-based encryptions; FinTech; Location privacy; Privacy preserving; Location based services",,,,,"Li, Y., Dai, W., Ming, Z., Privacy protection for preventing data over-collection in smart city (2016) IEEE Trans.

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings: The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in South Africa. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial technology innovation; South Africa; Theory of planned behaviour",,,,,,"Aassve, A., Sironi, M., Bassi, V., Explaining attitudes towards demographic behaviour (2013) European Sociological Review, 29 (2), pp. 316-333; Ajzen, I., Attitudes, traits, and actions: dispositional prediction of behavior in personality and social psychology (1987) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 20, pp. 1-63. , Berkowitz, L.

While possibly not the first application of financial technology, since 1971 time, the innovation in the financial industry has grown beyond expectations. However, most studies in innovation ignore the financial sector altogether. In this study, the authors investigate financial technology firms and innovation. After identifying firms that are considered financial technology, the authors collect innovation outcomes such as patents and data breaches associated with those firms.

We use e-payment index introduced by RMIT University and TRPC and apply quantile regression with GME approach. We consider the quantile level at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. At the low level of economic development variables, the Fintech have the highest effects on these variables compared with the medium and high level of economic development. In other words, Fintech supports not only low level of growth and productivity but also reduce the low level of price volatility and income inequity. Further investigation provides that e-payment usage and technology empowerment are helpful to economic development, particularly, increasing in growth and productivity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The methodology adapted in this paper is qualitative secondary research case study method. The study undertook a literature review analysis where the literature of more than fifty research papers and reports were analyzed and themes were generated. Hence twelve such themes evolved and then thematic content analysis was executed through grounded theory method. The reliability of the data source mentioned were taken from relevant organizations involved in cross border payments and validation of the reports were done by experts in this field of financial ecosystem. SWIFT still enjoys monopoly in the market in terms of its huge network and the number of banks it partners across 200 + countries in the world. But the new block chain technology launched by Ripple and Bitcoin and other small start-ups has posed a challenge to the existing traditional cross border payment system of SWIFT. Block chain has a peer-to-peer communication with no intermediary network required. It involves a simple transaction charge with the flexibility to share documents over network for better transparency. But SWIFT having a legacy incredibility and trust can ensure more reliable services to the businesses in cross border payments. © BEIESP.","Digital payment; Incredibility; Monopoly; SWIFT",,,,,,"Young, G.O., Synthetic structure of industrial plastics (Book style with paper title and (1964) Plastics, 3, pp. 15-64. , 2nd ed., J.

To analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-Demand-driven model, Supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good. Particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries. That is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution. Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in Korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth. © 2019 by the authors.","Exogenous specification; Fintech; Innovation; Input-output analysis; Sustainable growth","demand analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; finance; information technology; innovation; input-output analysis; national economy; sustainability; Korea",,,,,"Basole, R.C., Patel, S.S., Transformation through unbundling: Visualizing the global FinTech ecosystem (2018) Serv.

It is argued that situating this emergent ‘turn to technology’ in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the Global South offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism. The article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of ‘neoliberal reason’, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with Marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets. In this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to ‘re-engineer’ the market, and also seen as a doomed project. Empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the World Bank and G20. © The Author(s) 2019.","development; financial inclusion; Fintech; markets; neoliberalism; poverty","European Union; financial market; governance approach; neoliberalism; poverty; World Bank",,,,,"(2010), Seoul: G20; (2011), https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/afi_maya_quick_guide_withoutannex_i_and_ii.pdf, (,) A quick guide to the Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion. :, (accessed 2 July 2019; (2018), https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-09/Sochi_FS18_AW_digital.pdf, (,) Sochi Accord: Fintech for financial inclusion. :, (accessed 2 July 2019; Aitken, R., The financialization of microcredit (2013) Development and Change, 44 (3), pp. 473-499; Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: Constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition & Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Arráiz, I., Bruhn, M., Stucchi, R., (2015), (, a) Psychometrics as a tool to improve screening and access to credit.

The central hypothesis for this chapter was that SMEs' intentions to use IAP were a result of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This chapter also suggested that perceived ease of use and intention was mediated by perceived usefulness of the IAP. Using primary data collection method, 163 questionnaires were collected from SMEs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia using the purposive sampling technique. The data were analysed using SPSS and SmartPLS. The chapter found that perceived ease of use had significant influences on SMEs intention to use the IAP while perceived ease of use significantly affected perceived usefulness and the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention was mediated by perceived usefulness of the IAP. The results of this chapter suggested strategies to promote the platform as a fund seeking platform for SMEs. © 2020, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Achsien, I.H., Purnamasari, D.L., Islamic Crowd-funding as The Next Financial Innovation in Islamic Finance: Potential and Anticipated Regulation in Indonesia (2016) European Journal of Islamic Finance Voluntary, 5, pp. 1-11; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behaviour (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Akter, S., D'Ambra, J., Ray, P., (2011) An Evaluation of PLS Based Complex Models: The Roles of Power Analysis, Predictive Relevance and GOF Index, pp. 1-7. , In 7th AMCIS Proceedings, Academic Press; Alaeddin, O., Altounjy, R., Trust, technology awareness and satisfaction effect into the intention to use cryptocurrency among generation Z in Malaysia (2018) International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 120 (2), pp. 7-10; Alonso, Crowdfunding in Islamic Finance and Microfinance: A Case Study of Egypt (2015) Access to Finance and Human Development - Essays on Zakah, Awqaf and Microfinance, 1, pp. 85-94. , Academic Press; Aqidah, N., Mohd, S., Palil, R., Crowdfunding: a Collaborative Waqf Based Internet Platform (2016) International Journal of Business, Economics and Law, 11 (5), pp. 41-46. , http://ijbel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IJBEL-57.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Facilitating Equity Crowdfunding in the ASEAN Region, , Author; Auzzir, Z., Haigh, R., Amaratunga, D., Impacts of Disaster to SMEs in Malaysia (2018) Procedia Engineering, 212, pp. 1131-1138; Aziz, M.A., Che Wan, B.A., Platform Akaun Pelaburan - IAP Alternatif Baharu Usahawan Raih Teroka (2016) Berita Harian; Aziz, S., Md Husin, M., Hussin, N., Afaq, Z., Factors that influence individuals' intentions to purchase family takaful mediating role of perceived trust (2019) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 31 (1), pp. 81-104; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Bakar, N.A., Rosbi, S., Robust Framework Diagnostics of Blockchain for Bitcoin Transaction System: A Technical Analysis from Islamic Financial Technology (i -FinTech) Perspective (2018) International Journal of Business and Management, 2 (3), pp. 22-29; The State of Equity Crowdfunding: Equity Crowdfunding Insights and Analysis, , Author; (2018) World Fintech Report 2018, , Authors; (2016) Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework.

Similarly, the SC issued a digital investment management framework, another to facilitate equity crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and digital asset exchanges, and the instrumental digital currency and digital token order.

The contributions of SMEs in many countries' gross domestic product (GDP) have been overwhelming. SMEs improve job creation in all sectors of the economy and contribute to the people's economic wellbeing. However, many SMEs are not getting financing from their respective counties due to strict regulations and interest rate hike. With this kind of regulations and high interest, many brains are wasted, and many ideas are vanishing with the job opportunities attached them. Government agencies are therefore in need to innovate different ways to facilitate SME financing and support new businesses for achieving and maintaining sustainable economic growth.

Using a multiple regression model to estimate time series data based on a sample of 10 MENA zone countries for 2011, 2014, and 2017, the study contends that FinTech's lending activities increase inflation and that this effect could be interestingly moderated by sound policies and regulations. In addition, the authors find empirical support for the FinTech's role as a driver of economic growth and a breeding ground for innovative projects in a context of freedom of expression, association, and media. In terms of practical implications, decision makers are asked to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote the positive role of FinTech in terms of economic performance. © 2020, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Adam, Walker, (2016) Mobile Money and Monetary Policy in East African Countries, , University of Oxford; (2016) Applications for Future Internet, , International Summit, Puebla, Mexico; Alvarez, L., Lippi, F., Cash burns: An inventory model with a cash-credit choice (2017) Italy Journal of Monetary Economics, 90, pp. 99-112; Aron, J.M., Sebudde, (2015) Inflation Forecasting Models for Uganda: Is Mobile Money Relevant?, , CSAE Working, Paper 2015-17, Centre for the Study of African Economies; Aron, R., Sohal, (2017) Fintech: Is This Time Different?

In this regard, the ultimate goal of the study is to present a projection to the market actors and decision makers in order to be able to enhance the share of Islamic finance in the sector. The interview findings of the study indicate that (1) new technological products and services will dominate the banking sector and these will change the way of doing business in the near future; (2) perception, knowledge, infrastructure, service network, and campaign factors affect the Islamic banking preferences of the customers; and (3) the challenges of legal acts, confidence, competition, and human resources primarily influence the development of the financial ecosystem. © 2020, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Alaabed, A., Mirakhor, A., Accelerating Risk Sharing Finance via FinTech: NextGen Islamic Finance (2017) The 1st International Colloquium on Islamic Banking and Islamic Finance, pp. 1-10; Asutay, M., The development of Islamic banking in Turkey: regulation, performance and political economy (2013) Islamic finance in Europe: Towards a plural financial system, pp. 213-226. , In V.

The impact of technological developments leads to a new business models that disrupts their predecessors. Financial Technology (FinTech) is one example of a new business model in the financial world that is predicted to disrupt the banking business model. Hence, it is important to do a study on the potential switching of traditional bank's customers to FinTech lending services using Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) framework. The samples in this study were banking customers covering conventional and Islamic banks domiciled in Jakarta, Indonesia and the data was later analyzed using multinomial logistic regression (MLR). The results showed that PPM effects suggested that there was a tendency of traditional banks' customers to switch to FinTech lending services. It was revealed that the potential of traditional bank's customers who may be moving to FinTech lending services is 98.82 percent. This research results provide useful insight for managerial as a strategic step to determine the appropriate policies toward the potential of customer switching for banking industries, FinTech lending, as well as the regulators in Indonesia. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

This paper aimed to determine the important factors of financial technology adoption by hospital clustering with Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP) method. This paper used the questionnaire from 35 hospital experts as the respondents from all around Indonesia. Scope data in this paper came from outpatient unit administration payment in Hospital. Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (ANP) were used to find the most significant factor from Technology, Organization, Environment, Human (TOEH) framework. This paper found that the most important factor and sub-factor for the hospitals in cluster 1 were technology and compatibility. Meanwhile, for the hospitals in the cluster 2, the most important factor was environment and the most important sub-factor was government pressure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Finance; Hospitals; Risk management; Surveys; Systems engineering; Fuzzy analytical network process; Health services; Importance factors; Indonesia; Money transactions; Technology adoption; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Amalia, F., The fintech book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries (2016) Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, 31, pp. 345-348; Dalgleish, T., (2007) Fintech the Technology Driving Disruption in the Financial Services Industry., 136, pp. x-xi. , New York: CRC Press; (2018) Fintech Report 2018, , dailysocial.id; (2018) Jumlah Transaksi Uang Elektronik Beredar, , Bank Indonesia.

YuEbao is selected as the subject as it is a representative example of FinTech services in China. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was deployed and a ten-point sliding scale with two-decimal points was applied to improve the accuracy of the questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: Trust in service and structural assurance can encourage continuance intention of FinTech service. System quality, situational normality and subjective norm can boost the development of trust in service. Both herding and subjective norm can affect structural assurance significantly. Research limitations/implications: The study highlights the important roles played by technical factors (i.e. situational normality and system quality) and social factors (i.e. herding and subjective norm) in developing the two levels of trust (i.e. trust in service and structural assurance). It also validates the influences of trust in service and structural assurance on encouraging customers’ continuance intention in the novel context of FinTech. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be used by practitioners to encourage customers to continue using their FinTech services. To encourage continuance, service providers can improve the quality of their system, design the system to be aligned with customers’ using habits and show customers that their close friends are also using the service. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing body of trust literature by investigating the direct effects of trust in service and structure assurance on continuance intention and how these two levels of trust are developed from technical and social aspects. It generates interesting insights into customers’ continuance behavior of FinTech services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; FinTech; Herding; Structural assurance; Subjective norm; Trust","Least squares approximations; Social aspects; Surveys; Continuance intentions; FinTech; Herding; Structural assurance; Subjective norm; Trust; Sales",,,,,"Alqasa, K.M., The impact of students’ attitude and subjective norm on the behavioural intention to use services of banking system (2014) International Journal of Business Information Systems, 15 (1), pp. 105-122; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of Fintech: a new post-crisis paradigm (2016) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47 (4), pp. 1271-1273; Bao, H., Li, B., Shen, J., Hou, F., Repurchase intention in Chinese e-marketplace: roles of interactivity, trust and perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (2016) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 116 (8), pp. 1759-1778; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Peria, M.S.M., Reaching out: access to and use of banking services across countries (2007) Journal of Financial Economics, 85 (1), pp. 2334-2366; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Peria, M.S.M., Banking services for everyone?

Previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization. However, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of ‘financial inclusion’ in practice. Drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation. Seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits—(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods. Looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credit scoring; Financial inclusion; financialization; historical materialism; psychometrics; science and technology studies; technology",,,,,,"(2010) Innovative financial inclusion: Principles and report on innovative financial inclusion from the access through innovation sub-group of the G20 Financial Inclusion Experts Group, , Seoul: G20; Agarwala, R., (2013) Informal labour, formal politics, and dignified discontent in India, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Aitken, R., The financialization of microcredit (2013) Development and Change, 44 (3), pp. 473-499; Aitken, R., All data is credit data: Constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition & Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Arráiz, I., Bruhn, M., Stucchi, R., (2015) Psychometrics as a tool to improve screening and access to credit, 7506. , World Bank Policy Research Working Paper; Arráiz, I., Bruhn, M., Stucchi, R., (2015) Psychometrics as a tool to improve screening and access to credit, 625. , Inter-American Development Bank Working Paper Series IDB-WP; Bateman, M., (2010) Why doesn’t microfinance work?

Therefore, with this fast-growing market, Fintech Companies need to know their user opinion in Realtime in order to face their competitor on the market. Existing user review on Application Store already existed but there are no classification based on the subject of the review, because it only focus on the application not on the business level, therefore there are in need of a sentiment analysis to classify a user review based on the subject, in this paper we do a sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes algorithm in Bahasa Indonesia and in English, while also seeing the significance of data cleansing on the data, the resulted accuracy of the test in this paper between the analysis is 78% for English and Bahasa, and 75% for Bahasa Only. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Some of the implementations do not implement OAuth specifications correctly. This creates critical vulnerabilities on the FinTech applications that circumstances give rise a negative impact on FinTech companies. In this paper, we have analyzed 18 authorization servers that are used by FinTech applications. We have selected and analyzed resource servers (more than 100 applications) that use these OAuth servers to find their vulnerabilities. We have found some vulnerabilities on the flow of OAuth implementations. We propose a framework to reduce the implementation vulnerabilities on the flow. Our analyses results show that the proposed framework will help developers to reduce the most common vulnerabilities on OAuth flow. © 2019 IEEE.","Authorization; FinTech; OAuth; Security; Vulnerability","Computer science; Computers; Industrial engineering; Authorization; FinTech; OAuth; Security; Vulnerability; Engineering",,,,,"(2012) The OAuth 2. 0 Authorization Framework, , IETF Std.

FinTech 2.0 companies are able to capture more of the payment economics and offer merchants a better experience. While a software company can pursue multiple pathways to offer payments to its customers, the only way to fully capture the benefits of FinTech 2.0 is to become a payment facilita-tor (payfac). Thanks to the emergence of dedicated infrastructure providers, this is now much easier.

In this respect, the paper discusses the role of such drivers as increasing regulation, digitalisation, the drive for efficiency, and the general lack of agility among incumbent financial services providers to respond to changing corporate needs and expectations. The paper also discusses how these factors have driven financial institutions to invest in and partner with specialist FinTechs, and consequently, elevated investment levels and investor interest in the B2B FinTech space. The paper describes how these trends are likely to develop in the future and how it will become ever more important for incumbent financial services providers to partner with FinTechs to offer niche and tailored solutions to remain competitive. This paper also discusses what the future will look like and how the landscape will look signifi-cantly more intricate in the future. Consequently, the authors discuss how consolidation within the B2B FinTech space is expected to continue, while the emergence of tech giants in the financial services space represents the potential for a TechFin future. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","B2B FinTech; Cooperation; Future of FinTech; Investment; Payments; Regulation",,,,,,"(2019) The Pulse of Fintech, , https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/02/the-pulse-of-fintech-2018.pdf; (2018) PwC’s 2018 Digital Banking Consumer Survey: Mobile Users Set the agenda’, , https://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/publications/assets/pwc-fsi-whitepaper-digital-banking-consumer-survey.pdf; Beck, P., (2019) Middle-Market Companies Progressing Toward Digital B2B Payments Adoption, , https://www.paymentsjournal.com/middle-companies-digital-b2b-payments/; (2018) Bank of the Future’, , https://www.citi.com/commercialbank/insights/assets/docs/2018/The-Bank-of-the-Future/files/assets/common/downloads/The%20Bank%20of%20the%20Future.pdf; Galvin, J., Han, F., Hynes, S., Qu, J., Rajgopal, K., Shek, A., (2018) Synergy and Disruption: Ten Trends Shaping Fintech, , https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/synergy-and-disruption-ten-trends-shaping-fintech; Bendik Heggtveit, O., Gotteberg, G., Kude, O., Strauß, M., (2018) What Do Corporate Banking Customers Really Want?, , https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2018/what-do-corporate-banking-customers-really-want.aspx; (2019) Fintech Bridges across the globe’, , https://kae.com/infographic/Fintech-Bridges-Across-The-Globe/; (2019) Fintech Cooperation Agreements, , http://www.mas.gov.sg/Singapore-Financial-Centre/Smart-Financial-Centre/FinTech-Cooperations.aspx; (2019) London on Track to Become Global Fintech hub’, , https://thefintechtimes.com/london-global-fintech-hub/, accessed 2nd July, 2019; Kehoe, D., (2019) Ireland Must Aim to Be a Fintech Hub, Available At: Https://Www.Independent.Ie/Business/Irish/Derek-Kehoe-Ireland-Must-Aim-To-Be-A-Fintech-Hub-38235274.Html (Accessed 2Nd July, 2019); Sabba, K., (2019) Paris Will Be the Home of Europes Post-Brexit Fintech future’, , https://www.financemagnates.com/fintech/investing/paris-will-be-the-home-of-europes-post-brexit-fintech-future/, available at; Jeffery, C., Wardwell, B., (2019) 2019 B2B Payments Survey Report, , https://www.bottomline.com/us/resources/resource-center/research-reports/2019-b2b-payments-survey-report, available at; (2018) Starling Bank Expands Payment Services and Banking-As-A-Service Offer, , https://www.starlingbank.com/news/expanding-banking-services/; Rolfe, A., (2019) Google Granted E-Money Licence for EU, , https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/google-granted-e-money-licence-for-eu/; (2015) In the Future, BBVA Will Be a Software Company — Francisco Gonzalez, , https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/27080/in-the-future-bbva-will-be-a-software-company---francisco-gonzalez; Hellebust, S., Krogsrud, M., Swift, M., (2018) DNB’s Evolution to a Tech Company with a Banking License, , https://www.kornferry.com/institute/download/download/id/18445/aid/1925",,,,"Henry Stewart Publications",,,,,17501806,,,,"English","J.

However, the state of the testing practice in the FinTech industry still heavily relies on manual efforts. Our recent research efforts contributed our previous approach as the first attempt to automate the testing process in China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) Information Technology Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Chinas Central Bank that provides Chinas foreign exchange transactions, and revealed that automating test generation for such complex trading platform could help alleviate some of these manual efforts. In this paper, we investigate further the dilemmas faced in testing the CFETS trading platform, identify the importance of domain knowledge in its testing process, and propose a new approach of domain-specific test generation to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our previous approach in industrial settings. We also present findings of our empirical studies of conducting domain-specific testing on subsystems of the CFETS Trading Platform. © 2019 ACM.","Automated test generation; Domain knowledge; FinTech","Commerce; Efficiency; Electronic trading; Testing; Automated test generations; Complicated systems; Conducting domains; Domain knowledge; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Empirical studies; FinTech; Industrial settings; Software testing",,,,,"Antonio, P., Salas, P., Aichernig, B.K., Automatic test case generation for ocl: A mutation approach (2006) Proceeding of International Conference on Quality Software, pp. 64-71; Cadar, C., Dunbar, D., Engler, D., Klee: Unassisted and automatic generation of high-coverage tests for complex systems programs (2008) Proceedings of USENIX Conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 209-224; Cadar, C., Ganesh, V., Pawlowski, P., Dill, D., Engler, D., Exe: A system for automatically generating inputs of death using symbolic execution (2006) Proceedings of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 322-335; Fraser, G., Arcuri, A., Evosuite: Automatic test suite generation for object-oriented software (2011) Proceedings of ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 416-419; Koopman, P., Toward a scalable method for quantifying aspects of fault tolerance, software assurance, and computer security (1998) Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Security, Dependability, and Assurance: From Needs to Solutions, pp. 103-131; Miller, K., Global fintech investment rockets to a record $111 (2019) 8B in 2018, Driven by Mega Deals: KPMG Pulse of Fintech.

It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers’ attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Practical implications: Banks and other firms in the finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers. Marketing tactics applied should consider the customer’s level of familiarity with robots. Originality/value: This research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables. It contributes to understanding consumers’ perceptions regarding the introduction of AI in FinTech. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Finance; Robo-advisors; Robots; Technology adoption","Artificial intelligence; Finance; Robots; Sales; Design/methodology/approach; Perceived usefulness; Potential customers; Research frameworks; Robo-advisors; Socio-demographic variables; Structural equation modeling; Technology adoption; Intelligent robots",,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Restrepo, P., (2017) Robots and jobs: evidence from US labor markets, , https://voxeu.org/article/robots-and-jobs-evidence-us, (accessed, July 29, 2018; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Algesheimer, R., Dholakia, U.M., Herrmann, A., The social influence of brand communities: evidence from European car clubs (2005) Journal of Marketing, 59 (3), pp. 19-34; Anderson, J., Gerbing, D., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Bagozzi, R., The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift (2007) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8 (4), pp. 244-254; Bagozzi, R.P., Dholakia, U.M., Open source software user communities: a study of participation in Linux user groups (2006) Management Science, 52 (7), pp. 1099-1115; Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Understanding the influence of social information sources on e-government adoption (2012) Information Research, 17 (3), pp. 1-27; Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Guinalíu, M., The effect of culture in forming e-loyalty intentions: a cross-cultural analysis between Argentina and Spain (2015) Business Research Quarterly, 18 (4), pp. 275-292; Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Pérez-Rueda, A., Determinants of multi-service smartcard success for smart cities development: a study based on citizens’ privacy and security perceptions (2015) Government Information Quarterly, 32 (2), pp. 154-163. , www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X15000222; Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Guinalíu, M., Reciprocity and commitment in online travel communities (2019) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 119 (2), pp. 397-411; Bhattacherjee, A., Acceptance of e-commerce services: the case of electronic brokerages (2000) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Systems and Humans, 30 (4), pp. 411-420; Bhattacherjee, A., Understanding information systems continuance: an expectation-confirmation model (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 351-370; Bolton, R.N., Parasuraman, A., Hoefnagels, A., Migchels, N., Kabadayi, S., Gruber, T., Loureiro, Y.K., Solnet, D., Understanding generation Y and their use of social media: a review and research agenda (2013) Journal of Service Management, 24 (3), pp. 245-267; Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Guinalíu, M., The role of perceived usability, reputation, satisfaction and consumer familiarity on the website loyalty formation process (2008) Computers in Human Behavior, 24 (2), pp. 325-345; Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Guinalíu, M., Antecedents and consequences of consumer participation in on-line communities: the case of the travel sector (2010) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15 (2), pp. 137-167; Casalo, L.V., Flavian, C., Guinaliu, M., Ekinci, Y., Do online hotel rating schemes influence booking behaviors?

The fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business. The problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies. This paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in Indonesia. A number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products. The results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively. In addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction. However, in the current time, P2P fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons. © 2019 IEEE.","analysis of regression; customer satisfaction; digital disruption; net promoter score; payment gateway; peer-to-peer","Information management; Peer to peer networks; Sales; Sampling; Testing; analysis of regression; digital disruption; net promoter score; Payment gateways; Peer to peer; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Gomber, P., Kauffman, R.J., Parker, C., Weber, B.W., On the fintech revolution: Interpreting the forces of innovation, disruption, and transformation in financial services (2018) Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, pp. 220-265; Demyanyk, Y., Kolliner, D., Peer-to-peer lending is poised to grow (2014) Economic Trends; Paulus, Y.E., The emergence of peer-to-peer lending in Indonesia: A study of risk management analysis on conventional banking companies (2018) International Journal of Management and Applied Science (IJMAS), 4, pp. 34-40; Bunea, S., Kogan, B., Stolin, D., Banks vs fintech: At last, it's official' (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 44, pp. 122-131; Temelkov, Z., Fintech firms opportunity or threat for banks?

The number of KoinWorks mobile application users is increasing however there are still some obstacles along the way. Canceled order rates of KoinWorks are still quite high. In 2017, there are only 7,5% of the total users who actually did the transaction. In addition, the result of a preliminary study conducted on 114 respondents shows that nearly 75% of the users find it difficult to use the application. This study aims to evaluate the usability of KoinWorks mobile application, to analyze the existing usability problem, and to achieve a better usability interface design. Usability is measured using both quantitative and qualitative measurements. The quantitative measurement comprises user performance metrics such as task success, time on task and error that measure effectiveness and efficiency of the mobile application as well as saccade on eye tracking. The qualitative measurements include the System Usability Scale questionnaire (SUS), Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) and Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA). This study shows that KoinWorks mobile application has a poor performance and usability.

One article in particular by Tavneet Suri and William Jack published in the leading publication Science has played a hugely influential role in promoting the fin-tech model in the global South using the example of Kenya’s iconic M-Pesa money transfer platform.

This paper concentrates on protecting sensitive rules when we assume that binary decision trees will be the models to be induced by the shared data. The suggested heuristic hiding technique is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that restrict data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties. In this article, we present a paradigm of using the Local Distortion Hiding (LDH) algorithm in a real-life financial data set to hide a sensitive rule. © 2019 IEEE.","Data mining; Decision tree rules; Gain ratio; Information gain; Local distortion hiding; Local distortion hiding; Privacy-preserving","Benchmarking; Binary trees; Cryptography; Data mining; Decision trees; Finance; Heuristic methods; Binary decision trees; Financial institution; Gain Ratio; Heuristic solutions; Information gain; Local distortion; Privacy preserving; Technology application; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,"Verykios, V.S., Bertino, E., Fovino, I., Provenza, L., Saygin, Y., Theodoridis, Y., State-of-the-art in privacy-preserving data mining (2004) ACM SIGMOD Record, 33, p. 50; Brumen, B., Hericko, M., Sevcnikar, A., Zavr nik, J., Hölbl, M., Outsourcing Medical Data Analyses: Can Technology Overcome Legal, Privacy, and Confidentiality Issues?

Design/methodology/approach: Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study examines how experience in dealing with different fin-tech solutions, online reputation, innovation, capabilities and interest to apply for funding affect the desired outcome: turning freelancing services into entrepreneurial initiatives. Findings: Fin-tech enables freelancers to become smart entrepreneurs and tailors their experience to capture entrepreneurial opportunities allowing them to apply for funding to a large range of instruments. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to a small sample of fin-tech entrepreneurs and the generalization of results calls for caution. Originality/value: A configurational framework aiming to turn fin-tech freelancers into entrepreneurs is proposed, which encompasses the antecedent conditions of personal experience, reputation, innovation and commitment to find money for creating start-ups. © 2019","Entrepreneurship; Fin-tech; Freelancing; Innovation; Reputation",,,,,,"Annink, A., Den Dulk, L., Amorós, J.E., Different strokes for different folks?

Due to their nature, FinTech products can be used within the dedicated regulatory framework or into the deep layers of the Internet. This feature of FinTech alone could potentially undermine the existing financial services regulation (FSR), the aim of which is to ensure financial stability through investor protection measures and measures protecting the integrity of the financial market. To this end, much of the illegal activities on the Dark Web have an interconnected and cross-sectorial impact on the FSR’s aims—for example, the on-going problem with stealing of personal data has implications on investor protection, often via market manipulation channels. Such considerations make it relevant to analyse the ways FinTech used on the Dark Web could affect traditional and FinTech activities in the financial sector. How strong this impact could be would probably depend on how ubiquitous FinTech innovations are on the Deep or Dark Web. This article will argue that by definition their market presence is not only across the entire Internet, but also very high in volume. This is all the more the case because FinTechs brainchild, the cryptos, have become the go to currency for many activities outside the law. © 2019, Europäische Rechtsakademie (ERA).","Cryptos; Financial market; FinTech",,,,,,"(2016), https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/wet-regelgeving/marktmisbruik/brochure-insider-dealing.pdf, Updated 2017.

In order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for FinTech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans. Design/methodology/approach: The final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM), with estimation of partial least squares. Findings: From the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the FinTechs of Brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service. Research limitations/implications: The model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending FinTechs. Practical implications: The consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the Brazilian lending market. Originality/value: Aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending FinTechs in Brazil. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","FinTechs lending; Propensity to consume; Startups",,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., A conceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology (1998) Information Systems Research, 9 (2), pp. 204-215; Asuka, K., Misato, T., Hideki, H., Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the self-stigma scale in patients with type 2 diabetes (2014) Health & Quality of Life Outcomes, 12 (1), pp. 79-95; (2018) Brazilian Central Bank, , www.bcb.gov.br/en#!/home, (accessed, September 4, 2018; Bae, K.-H., Goyal, V.K., Creditor rights, enforcement, and bank loans (2009) The Journal of Finance, 64 (2), pp. 823-860; (2017) Relatório de Estabilidade Financeira, 16. , No 2, Banco Central do Brasil, Brasília; Boerema, A.M., Zoonen, K., Cuijpers, P., Holtmaat, C.M., Mokkink, L.B., Griffiths, K.M., Kleiboer, A.M., Psychometric properties of the Dutch depression stigma scale (DSS) and associations with personal and perceived stigma in a depressed and community sample (2016) Plos One, 11 (8), pp. 1-16; Bolander, W., Satornino, C.B., Hughes, D.E., Ferris, G.R., Social networks within sales organizations: their development and importance for salesperson performance (2015) Journal of Marketing, 79 (6), pp. 1-16; Chechen, L., Yi-Jen, H., Tung-Heng, H., Factors influencing internet banking adoption (2016) Social Behavior & Personality: An International Journal, 44 (9), pp. 1443-1455; Chen, D., Liu, X., Wang, C., Social trust and bank loan financing: evidence from china (2016) Abacus, 52 (3), pp. 374-403; Chin, W.W., The Partial Least Squares approach for structural equation modeling (1998) Methodology for Business and Management, Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336. , Marcoulides, G.A.

Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments. These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution. Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs) based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e. 83% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the precision is 33%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e. 94% as compared to other classifiers). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber threat attribution; Cyber threat intelligence; Deep learning neural network; FinTech threat attribution; Machine learning; Tactics techniques and procedures","Deep neural networks; Gages; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Semantics; Cyber threats; Distributional semantics; FinTech threat attribution; Forensic investigation; Human consumption; Learning neural networks; NAtural language processing; Tactics techniques and procedures; Malware",,,,,"(2015), https://www.fpc.gov/19081/, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA); Congress, U.S., (2015), 2015, S. 754 cybersecurity information sharing act of; Wheeler, D.A., Larsen, G.N., (2003), Techniques for cyber attack attribution, Tech. rep., Institute For Defense Analyses Alexandria VA; Hunker, J., Hutchinson, B., Margulies, J., Role and challenges for sufficient cyber-attack attribution (2008) Inst.

Traditional curricula of Finance had been built upon the framework of classic Economics, and this model started falling short providing qualified graduates to the financial workforce as the landscape changed. Financial Technology (FinTech) was the response, a newborn approach designed to address the gap. The curricula of conventional financial subjects lacked the practicality for studies, and the link between teaching and assessment needed revisiting. FinTech addresses the practicality and the link through carefully considering the transferability of applicable skills taught in education, Industry-Academia Collaboration, simply meaning to prepare students with practical skills that align with needs from the industry. This paper proposes a new curriculum model of FinTech based on the integration of teaching and talent needs from the finance industry. Practice is infused into the model, to which the step of corporation assessment of practice is introduced. This curriculum covers three parts, which are: 1) curriculum framework, 2) creativity of curriculum structure, and 3) assessment of practice. The subject construction and development of FinTech are discussed and elaborated from the above three perspectives. Curriculum development aims to create an educational environment where the needs from the industry are addressed and combined into the pedagogy. © 2019 ACM.","Curriculum Development; FinTech; Industry-Academia Collaboration","Education computing; Educational technology; Finance; Students; Curriculum development; Curriculum structure; Educational environment; Finance industries; Financial industry; FinTech; Integrating information; Teaching and assessments; Curricula",,,,,"Pollari, I., Ruddenklau, A., The pulse of fintech 2018-biannual global analysis of investment in fintech (2019) KPMG International Cooperative, , https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/02/the-pulse-of-fintech-2018.pdf; Pollari, I., 2018 fintech100-leading global fintech innovators (2018) KPMG International Cooperative, , https://h2.vc/wpcontent/uploads/2018/11/Fintech100-2018-Report_Final_22-11-18sm.pdf; Minfeng, L., Yangyang, X., Research on the development strategy of financial technology industry-taking jiangsu province as an example [J/OL] Financial Theory and Practice, 2019 (4), pp. 32-41. , In Chinese; Enlin, T., Xiaoquan, H., Finance teaching reform at in application-oriented colleges and universities under the background of sci-tech and finance integration and universities under the background of sci-tech and finance integration [J] (2016) Journal of Anqing Teachers College (Social Science Edition), 35 (3), pp. 154-157; Fangjiao, S., The reform of financial education and talents development against the backdrop of the integration of technology and finance [J] Shanghai Finance, 2013 (8), pp. 113-114. , 119; Jiao, L., Practice of the training mode of financial professionals in the era of internet plus [J] Journal of the Staff and Worker's University, 2019 (1), pp. 85-89. , 66 In Chinese; Yu, X., Curriculum reform and construction of financial engineering under the background of financial science and technology [J] (2019) Education Modernization, 6 (10), pp. 91-93. , In Chinese; Feng, L., Li, H., Research on the innovation strategy of financial professionals training in local colleges and universities from the perspective of financial science and technology [J] (2018) Education Modernization, 5 (48), pp. 5-7. , In Chinese; Lili, F., Bo, Z., Innovative study of fully developed financial talents under the new era of financial technology [J] Journal of Hangzhou Finance Institute, 2018 (7), pp. 65-67; Jianjun, L., Yongbin, L., Thinking on the construction of internet finance course and talent training mode [J] China University Teaching, 2018 (5), pp. 64-68. , In Chinese; Lu, S., Yuqi, S., Innovative research on the cultivation of financial professional under the background of fintech [J] Foreign Economic Relations & Trade, 2018 (10), pp. 136-137; Feng, C., Industry-Academia Collaboration: The path of deepening and evolution [J] (2018) China Higher Education, (Z2), pp. 13-16. , In Chinese; Shihua, N., Pin, Y., Wenqi, S., Domestic and foreign practice reference and enlightenment of industry-academia collaboration [J] Modern Enterprise Industry, 2016 (4), pp. 66-67. , In Chinese; Minfeng, Z., The new normal of economy, financial technology and the cultivation of financial professionals in local colleges and universities [J] Financial Theory and Teaching, 2018 (1), pp. 91-94. , In Chinese; Hongman, W., Exploration and research on the"" integration of curriculum and profession"" the cultivation of financial talents in independent colleges-taking the school of law and business of hubei university of economics as an example [J] (2016) Journal of Hubei University of Economics (Humanities and Social Sciences), 13 (11), pp. 209-210. , In Chinese",,,,"Association for Computing Machinery","2019 International Conference on Modern Educational Technology, ICMET 2019","28 June 2019 through 30 June 2019",,150197,,9781450372220,,,"English","ACM Int.

The recent proliferation of the mobile payment sector led by innovative mobile Fintech payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay is the most important and fastest growing Fintech services from consumers’ perspective. Although businesses have been making efforts to spread the use of the services, security is crucial in the diffusion of the services. Despite the importance, the role of perceived security in continuous intention to use mobile, Fintech services has not yet been investigated in depth. Thus, this study investigates the relationships between perceived security, knowledge regarding the services, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. We propose a research model using an extended post-acceptance model (EPAM) as a theoretical framework in the context of Fintech services. We then validate the model using the data collected from the service users. The analyzed results show that knowledge and perceived security in mobile Fintech services have a significant influence on users’ confirmation and perceived usefulness. However, perceived security does not directly influence users’ satisfaction and continual intention to use.

Furthermore, the number of secure Internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force has a positive impact on the development of this new market segment. Finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country.

It first traces the history of FinTech and its evolution both globally and in Africa. Then it reviews the impact of selected FinTech products in African countries. Several observations are noteworthy. First, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in Africa. Second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate SME funding constraints is crowdfunding. However, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in Africa, the region with the lowest penetration.

The financial sector has changed from a traditional one marked by conventional financial intermediation structures towards an increasingly technology-affected one. Not only this change but anticipated developments too require if not extensively reconsidering the design of financial regulation,1 then at least not turning a blind eye to shaping developments. Whether the numerous recently sprouting bilateral fintech cooperation agreements are adequate transnational regulatory instruments to address fintech effectively across borders is for this paper to elucidate. © 2019 The Author(s).

Recent advances in cryptography, data analytics, and machine learning are visibly ""disrupting"" traditional methods of delivering financial services and conducting financial transactions. Less visibly, fintech is also changing the way we think about finance: it is gradually recasting our collective understanding of the financial system in normatively neutral terms of applied information science. By making financial transactions easier, faster, and cheaper, fintech seems to promise a micro-level ""win-win "" solution to the financial system's many ills. This Article challenges such narratives and presents an alternative account of fintech as a systemic, macro-level phenomenon. Grounding the analysis of evolving fintech trends in a broader institutional context, the Article Exposes the normative and political significance of fintech as the catalyst for a potentially decisive shift in the underlying public-private balance of powers, competencies, and roles in the financial system. In developing this argument, the Article makes three principal scholarly contributions. First, it introduces the concept of the New Deal settlement in finance: a fundamental political arrangement, in force for nearly a century, pursuant to which profit-seeking private actors retain control over allocating capital and generating financial risks,1 while the sovereign public bears responsibility for maintaining systemic financial stability. Second, the Article advances a novel conceptual framework for understanding the deep-seated dynamics that have eroded the New Deal settlement in recent decades. It offers a taxonomy of core mechanisms that both (a) enable private actors to continuously synthesize tradable financial assets and scale up trading activities, and (b) undermine the public's ability to manage the resulting system-wide risks. Finally, the Article shows how and why specific fintech applications-cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger technologies, digital crowdfunding, and robo-advising-are poised to amplify the effect of these destabilizing mechanisms, and thus potentially exacerbate the tensions and imbalances in today's financial markets and the broader economy. It is this potential that renders fintech a public policy challenge of the highest order. © 2019 Yale Journal on Regulation.

Customers no longer expect their bank to provide the best digital experience (DX) amongst its peers, but amongst all the organizations they interact with. Due to a plethora of data, fintech startups have gained significant grip, by introducing innovative and successfully offering products and distinctive solutions for consumer demand, efficiently and conveniently at lower transaction cost. In view of increased number of digitally enlighten customer and rising adoption rate of finTecc, the banks and fintech firms should not view as a rivalry to each other but as collaborative partner on the grounds of their relevance and interdependence.

We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

This special issue is the result. In this introductory article, we describe the recent FinTech phenomenon and the novel editorial protocol employed for this special issue following the Registered Reports format.We discuss what we learned from the submitted proposals about the field of FinTech and which ones we selected to be completed and ultimately come out in this special issue. We also provide several observations to help guide future research in the emerging area of FinTech.

Each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives. This situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code. The objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance. In this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels. Omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices. As the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services. Additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment. Production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side. As importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort. © 2019","Multimodal user interface definition; Omni-channel banking services; Omni-channel user experience","Computer software selection and evaluation; Convolutional codes; Software design; Banking services; Development environment; Multimodal user interface; Production environments; Representative sample; User experience; User interface development; User interface prototypes; User interfaces",,,,,"Alt, R., Beck, R., Smits, M.T., Fintech and the transformation of the financial industry (2018) Electronic Markets - The International Journal on Networked Business, 28, pp. 235-245. , Springer; Kotarba, M., New factors inducing changes in the retail banking customer relationship management (crm) and their exploration by the fintech industry (2016) Found.

We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard’s (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard’s applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results. Finally, we discuss open research issues. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Application security; Blockchain; Compliance; Financial technology; Payment card industry; Privacy; Security frameworks; Security standards; Smart contracts; User data","Blockchain; Data privacy; Ethereum; Network security; Application security; Compliance; Payment card industries; Security frameworks; Security standards; User data; Regulatory compliance",,,,,"Andrychowicz, M., Dziembowski, S., Malinowski, D., Mazurek, L., Secure multiparty computations on bitcoin (2014) 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 443-458. , IEEE, San Jose, CA, USA; Atzei, N., Bartoletti, M., Cimoli, T., A survey of attacks on ethereum smart contracts (SOK) (2017) Principles of Security and Trust, pp. 164-186. , Springer; Bartoletti, M., Pompianu, L., An empirical analysis of smart contracts: Platforms, applications, and design patterns (2017) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 494-509. , Springer, Sliema, Malta; Biryukov, A., Khovratovich, D., Pustogarov, I., Deanonymisation of clients in bitcoin P2P network (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 15-29. , ACM, Scottsdale, AZ, USA; Conti, M., Kumar, S., Lal, C., Ruj, S., A survey on security and privacy issues of Bitcoin (2018) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 20 (4), pp. 3416-3452. , 2018; Delmolino, K., Arnett, M., Kosba, A., Miller, A., Shi, E., Step by step towards creating a safe smart contract: Lessons and insights from a cryptocurrency lab (2016) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 79-94. , Springer, Christ Church, Barbados; Bello, G., Perez, A.J., (2018) Adapted PA-DSS Standards, , https://tinyurl.com/yabykwf8; Kosba, A., Miller, A., Shi, E., Wen, Z., Papamanthou, C., Hawk: The blockchain model of cryptography and privacy-preserving smart contracts (2016) 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 839-858. , IEEE, San Jose, CA, USA; Koshy, P., Koshy, D., McDaniel, P., An analysis of anonymity in Bitcoin using P2P network traffic (2014) International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 469-485. , Springer, Christ Church, Barbados; Luu, L., Chu, D., Olickel, H., Saxena, P., Hobor, A., Making smart contracts smarter (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 254-269. , ACM, Vienna, Austria; Di Ferrante, M., Mercer, R., (2017) Towards Blockchain Transaction Privacy, , https://www.clearmatics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IEEE-Presentation.pdf; Gray, M., Hajduk, C., (2017) Anatomy of A Smart Contract, , https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/AnatomyofASmartContract.md; Gray, M., Hajduk, C., (2017) Anatomy of A Smart Contract 2, , https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/scanatomy-2; Ma, S., Deng, Y., He, D., Zhang, J., Xie, X., An efficient NIZK scheme for privacy-preserving transactions over account-model blockchain (2017) IACR Cryptol. ePrint Arch., Tech.

In this practitioner note, the K-means clustering algorithm and LRFMP model are combined in the customer segmentation process. After initial clustering, for a better understanding of valuable customers, additional clustering is implemented in segments that needed further investigation. This approach contributes to a better interpretation of different customer segments. Customer segments, consisting of 23524 business customers are analysed based on their characteristics and appropriate strategies are recommended accordingly. The first stage clustering result shows that customers are best segmented into four groups. The first and fourth segments are clustered again and the final 11 groups of customers are determined. This note provides a systematic and practical approach for researchers and practitioners for segmentation, interpretation, and targeting of customers especially in the B2B setting and the Fintech industry and helps managers to make effective marketing strategies and enhance customer relationship and marketing intelligence. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","B2B; Cluster Analysis; Customer Segmentation; Fintech Industry; RFM Model",,,,,,"Chen, D., Sain, S.L., Guo, K., Data mining for the online retail industry: A case study of RFM model-based customer segmentation using data mining (2012) Journal of Database Marketing & Customer Strategy Management, 19 (3), pp. 197-208; Chen, K., Hu, Y.H., Hsieh, Y.C., Predicting customer churn from valuable B2B customers in the logistics industry: A case study (2015) Information Systems and e-Business Management, 13 (3), pp. 475-494; Colombo, R., Jiang, W., A stochastic RFM model (1999) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 13 (3), pp. 2-12; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A cluster separation measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, (2), pp. 224-227; Dibb, S., Market segmentation: Strategies for success (1998) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 16 (7), pp. 394-406; Hosseini, S.M.S., Maleki, A., Gholamian, M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop CRM methodology to assess the customer loyalty (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 5259-5264; Hsieh, N.C., An integrated data mining and behavioral scoring model for analyzing bank customers (2004) Expert Systems with Applications, 27 (4), pp. 623-633; Jonker, J.J., Piersma, N., Potharst, R., A decision support system for direct mailing decisions (2006) Decision Support Systems, 42 (2), pp. 915-925; Kandeil, D.A., Saad, A.A., Youssef, S.M., A two-phase clustering analysis for B2B customer segmentation (2014) Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 221-228. , September, IEEE: Salerno, Italy, and; Khajvand, M., Zolfaghar, K., Ashoori, S., Alizadeh, S., Estimating customer lifetime value based on RFM analysis of customer purchase behavior: Case study (2011) Procedia Computer Science, 3, pp. 57-63; Kim, J., Suh, E., Hwang, H., A model for evaluating the effectiveness of CRM using the balanced scorecard (2003) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 17 (2), pp. 5-19; King, S.F., Citizens as customers: Exploring the future of CRM in UK local government (2007) Government Information Quarterly, 24 (1), pp. 47-63; Li, D.C., Dai, W.L., Tseng, W.T., A two-stage clustering method to analyze customer characteristics to build discriminative customer management: A case of textile manufacturing business (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (6), pp. 7186-7191; Li, S.T., Shue, L.Y., Lee, S.F., Business intelligence approach to supporting strategy-making of ISP service management (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35 (3), pp. 739-754; Li, Y.M., Lin, C.H., Lai, C.Y., Identifying influential reviewers for word-of-mouth marketing (2010) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9 (4), pp. 294-304; Ngai, E.W., Xiu, L., Chau, D.C., Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management: A literature review and classification (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (2), pp. 2592-2602; Peker, S., Kocyigit, A., Eren, P.E., LRFMP model for customer segmentation in the grocery retail industry: A case study (2017) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 35 (4), pp. 544-559; Sohrabi, B., Khanlari, A., (2007) Customer lifetime value (CLV) measurement based on RFM model; Spring, P., Leeflang, P.S., Wansbeek, T., The combination strategy to optimal target selection and offer segmentation in direct mail (1999) Journal of Market-Focused Management, 4 (3), pp. 187-203; Wu, H.H., Chang, E.C., Lo, C.F., Applying RFM model and K-means method in customer value analysis of an outfitter (2009) Global Perspective for Competitive Enterprise, Economy and Ecology, , London: Springer, and,.

Under the background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. The technology company selection can be regarded as a kind of multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a useful tool to express decision makers’ (DMs’) evaluations in the technology company selection. This paper develops a new method for MAGDM with PLTSs. Firstly, the possibility degree and range value of PLTSs are defined. Then a possibility degree algorithm is designed for ranking PLTSs. An Euclidean distance measure between PLTSs is presented and extended to probabilistic linguistic matrices. Based on Archimedean t-norm and s-norm, some new operational laws for PLTSs are defined and some desirable properties are discussed. Then, a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher weighted averaging (GPLHWA) operator and a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher ordered weighted averaging (GPLHOWA) operator are developed. Some useful properties for these operators are investigated in detail. Combined with the subjective weights of DMs, the DMs’ weights are determined by the adjusted coefficients. Using the GPLHWA operator, the collective decision matrix is obtained by aggregating all the individual decision matrices. By maximizing the total weighted square possibility degree, a multi-objective program is constructed to derive the attribute weights. The ranking order of alternatives is generated by integrating ELECTRE and TOPSIS. Thereby, a new method is put forward for MAGDM with PLTSs. A Fintech example is analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The sensitivity analysis and comparative analyses are conducted to illustrate its advantages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregating operators; Multi-attribute group decision making; Operational laws; Probabilistic linguistic term sets","Finance; Linguistics; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Appropriate technologies; Comparative analysis; Euclidean distance measure; Linguistic terms; Multi-attribute group decision making; Multi-attribute group decision makings (MAGDM); Operational laws; Ordered weighted averaging; Decision making",,,,,"Wan, S.P., Wang, F., Dong, J.Y., A three-phase method for group decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (2018) IEEE Trans.

Close on the heels of this awakening comes the FinTech revolution which questions the role of traditional players in promoting the inclusion and fosters the same. While the regulated traditional banking channel has been engaged in meeting the challenges of inclusive growth, the emergence of technology is sweeping across the sub-continent marked by stupendous growth in electronic market, smart phone penetration, cloud based solutions and the emergence of financial technology companies providing services and products similar and parallel to banking. Even as FinTech seems to redefine the service quality and product delivery through innovative use of technology in design and delivery of financial products and services, there is a need to moderate the hype by introducing a robust regulatory framework to strike a balance between innovation and compliance and to ensure a service orientation over and above the pure commercial instinct. The instant paper attempts to examine the phenomenal role of FinTech in filling the wide gap of Financial Inclusion, the need for its reorientation towards poorest of the poor and the road ahead in the light of multiple challenges that it faces and poses to the traditional players. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain; Financial Inclusion; FinTech; G-20; HLPs; Sandbox","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Product design; Regulatory compliance; Smartphones; Financial inclusions; FinTech; G-20; HLPs; Sandbox; Finance",,,,,"(2018) UFA 2020 Overview, , http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/brief/achieving-universal-financial-access-by-2020, (Last accessed on 26.12; (2018) New G20 High Level Principles of Digital Financial Inclusion, , http://www.gpfi.org/news/new-g20-high-levelprinciples-digital-financial-inclusion, (Last accessed on 26.12; (2018) Financial Inclusion: Overview by World Bank Group, , http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview, (Last accessed on 26.12; Sinha, S., Pandey, K.R., Madan, N., FinTech and the demand side challenge in financial inclusion (2018) Enterprise Development & Microfinance [S.

The acquisitions of firms related to financial technologies are one of the ways to obtain vital knowledge. In order to identify the fintech companies we are looking at firms that are involved in business activities in both the IT and financial sectors. By examining the growing role of fintech firms in the recent mergers and acquisitions from an investor point of view, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the post-acquisition performance of the acquirer firms measured by abnormal returns. We discovered significant positive average abnormal return after acquisition of fintech companies in the short-term and negative average abnormal return in the long-term using event study methodology. The specifics of cross-border acquisitions, the level of the domestic market development of the acquirer, and other characteristics of M&A deals are considered in order to explain the reaction of investors to announcements of fintech firms’ acquisitions. The determinants of corresponding M&A deals in emerging and developed markets were revealed. © 2019","Cross-border M&A; Event study; Financial technologies; Mergers and acquisitions; Stock returns",,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Jaffe, J.F., Mandelker, G.N., The post-merger performance of acquiring firms: a re-examination of an anomaly (1992) The Journal of Finance, 47 (4), pp. 1605-1621; Agrawal, A., Jaffe, J.F., The post-merger performance puzzle (2000) Advances in Mergers and Acquisitions, 1, pp. 7-41; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: a longitudinal study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Asimakopoulos, G., Whalley, J., Market leadership, technological progress and relative performance in the mobile telecommunications industry (2017) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 123, pp. 57-67; Asquith, P., Merger bids, uncertainty, and stockholder returns (1983) Journal of Financial Economics, 11 (1-4), pp. 51-83; Barber, B.M., Lyon, J.D., Detecting long-run abnormal stock returns: the empirical power and specification of test statistics (1997) Journal of Financial Economics, 43, pp. 341-372; Beitel, P., Schiereck, D., Wahrenburg, M., Explaining M&A success in European banks (2004) European Financial Management, 1 (10), pp. 109-139; Berger, A., DeYoung, R., Genay, H., Udell, G., Globalisation of financial institutions: evidence from cross-border banking performance (2000) Brookings-Wharton Papers on Financial Service, 3, pp. 23-120; Berkovitch, E., Narayanan, M.P., Motives for takeovers: an empirical investigation (1993) The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 28 (3), pp. 347-362; Campa, J.M., Hernando, I., Shareholder value creation in European M&As (2004) European Financial Management, 10 (1), pp. 47-81; Campbell, J.Y., Lo, A.W., MacKinlay, A.C., The Econometrics of Financial Markets (1997); Chari, A., Oimet, P.P., Tesar, L.L., Acquiring control in emerging markets: Evidence from the Stock Market (2004), p. 10872. , National Bureau of Economic Research NBER Working Paper; Chen, X., Harford, J., Li, K., Monitoring: which institutions matter?

First, it is argued that the question that preoccupies ‘coherentists’ (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic ‘fiat contracts’ that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a ‘regulatory-instrumentalist’ nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had. Blockchain is a potentially transformative technology and it is important to have more fundamental conversations about the kind of community that we want to be. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Coherentism; Contract law; Regulatory-instrumentalism; Smart contracts; Technological management",,,,,,"Adams, J.N., Brownsword, R., (2007) Understanding contract law, , 5, Sweet and Maxwell, London; Adams, J.N., Beyleveld, D., Brownsword, R., Privity of contract—the benefits and the burdens of law reform (1997) Mod Law Rev, 60, pp. 238-264; Bayern, S., Burri, T., Grant, T.D., Häusermann, D.M., Möslein, F., Williams, R., Company law and autonomous systems: a blueprint for lawyers, entrepreneurs, and regulators (2017) Hast Sci Technol Law J, 9, pp. 135-162; Beyleveld, D., Brownsword, R., (2001) Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brincker, M., Privacy in public and the contextual conditions of agency (2017) Privacy in public space, pp. 64-90. , Timan T, Newell BC, Koops B-J, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Brownsword, R., Code, control, and choice: why east is east and west is west (2005) Legal Stud, 25, pp. 1-21; Brownsword, R., (2008) Rights, regulation and the technological revolution, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., Contracts in a networked world (2012) Commercial contract law: transatlantic perspectives, pp. 116-145. , Matteo L, Zhou Q, Saintier S, Rowley K, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Whither the law and the law books: from prescription to possibility (2012) J Law Soc, 39, pp. 296-308; Brownsword, R., Human dignity, human rights, and simply trying to do the right thing (2013) Understanding human dignity, pp. 345-358. , McCrudden C, (ed), The British Academy and Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., Regulatory coherence—a European challenge (2014) Varieties of European economic law and regulation: essays in honour of Hans Micklitz, pp. 235-258. , Purnhagen K, Rott P, (eds), Springer, Dordrecht; Brownsword, R., Crimes against humanity, simple crime, and human dignity (2014) Humanity across international law and biolaw, pp. 87-114. , Beers B, Corrias L, Werner W, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Human dignity from a legal perspective (2014) Cambridge handbook of human dignity, pp. 1-22. , Duwell M, Braavig J, Brownsword R, Mieth D, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., In the year 2061: from law to technological management (2015) Law Innov Technol, 7, pp. 1-51; Brownsword, R., Technological management and the rule of law (2016) Law Innov Technol, 8, pp. 100-140; Brownsword, R., The E-Commerce Directive, consumer transactions, and the digital single market: questions of regulatory fitness, regulatory disconnection and rule redirection (2017) European contract law in the digital age, pp. 165-204. , Grundmann S, (ed), Intersentia, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Law, liberty and technology (2017) The Oxford handbook of law, regulation and technology, pp. 41-68. , Brownsword R, Scotford E, Yeung K, (eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., From Erewhon to Alpha Go: for the sake of human dignity should we destroy the machines?

They need to re-evaluate their competitive advantages in light of profound changes driven by advances in information technology (IT) and competitive pressure from FinTech companies. This article emphasizes that banks should not abolish relationship banking, which nurtures close contact with bank customers. A long-term orientation of relationship banking streamlines incentives and supports the long-term needs of bank customers. However, banks might be lured into transaction banking due to the presence of IT-driven economies of scale and competition from FinTech start-ups and IT companies. In this light, the article evaluates the role of distances, artificial intelligence, and behavioral biases. Implications for stability in banking are explored. We argue that relationship banking can overcome its drawbacks, but it needs to adjust to the new reality in order to survive. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; FinTech; Information technology; Relationship banking; The future of banking",,,,,,"Agarwalben-David, S.I., Loan Prospecting and the Loss of Soft Information (2014) Journal of Financial Economics, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2403669, Forthcoming; Agarwal, S., Ben-David, I., Yao, V., Collateral Valuation and Borrower Financial Constraints: Evidence from the Residential Real Estate Market (2015) Management Science, 61 (9), pp. 2220-2240; Agarwal, S.I., Ben-Davidyao, V.W., Systematic Mistakes in the Mortgage Market and Lack of Financial Sophistication (2016) Journal of Financial Economics, , March 1.

Aiming to narrow this gap, the objective of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out new routes and opportunities in the field. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation. Finally, subjects related to financial services operation particularly deal with risks of financial loss related to different factors involved in the business environment of these organizations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Financial services; Financial technologies; Fintech; Innovation; Loans; Payment technologies; Systematic literature review","Blockchain; Electronic money; Laws and legislation; Losses; Crowdfunding; Financial service; Fintech; Loans; Systematic literature review; Finance",,,,,"Alabi, K., Digital blockchain networks appear to be following Metcalfe's Law (2017) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 24, pp. 23-29; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., 150 years of Fintech: An evolutionary analysis (2016) Jassa Finsia Journal Applied Finance, p. 22; Arnoldi, J., Derivatives: Virtual values and real risks.

Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of Fintech services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt Fintech services. We designed a questionnaire, sent it to active customers of the Hefei Science and Technology Rural Commercial Bank, and obtained 387 eligible responses. We analyzed the data with a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables. The results reveal that users' trust in Fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users' attitudes toward the adoption regarding Fintech services. This study contributes to the literature of the adoption of Fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of Fintech services with TAM. © 2019 by the authors.","Adoption; Fintech services; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"Gabor, D., Brooks, S., The Digital Revolution in Financial Inclusion: International Development in the Fintech Era (2017) New Polit.

While fintech implies more convenient and various financial services to customers, it leads to more complexity in the financial sector, as different industry players (e.g., IT firms) can participate in financial businesses. The complexity of fintech causes controversial issues related to policies and the appropriate development direction. In order to provide insight into the current state of fintech, this study explores the fundamental understanding of the fintech phenomenon from the perspective of the major stakeholders (i.e., financial authorities, financial companies, IT firms) in South Korea. This study analyzed news articles, where those stakeholders expressed their arguments, by using a content analysis. The study also conducted an intensive examination of their arguments by using a core-periphery approach of social representations. This study found that while the three beholders had a common opinion on deregulation of the fintech industry, each of them had different knowledge of the phenomenon. By revealing each beholder's structure of representations of fintech, this study not only provides common knowledge regarding fintech but also explicates the perceptual gaps among stakeholders. Findings of the study offer a big picture of current fintech initiatives, which can be useful knowledge for future research on fintech. © 2013 The Korean Society of Management Information Systems.","Content analysis; Core-periphery analysis; Fintech; Social representations theory",,,,,,"Abric, J.C., A structural approach to social representations (2001) Representations of the social: Bridging theoretical traditions, pp. 42-47. , In: K.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation of the banking sector in response to the challenges brought by Fintech startups. Based on the service innovation theory, we propose a novel hybrid multiple criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to evaluate service innovation strategies for improving the sustainability of China's banking industry during the Fintech revolution. A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models. These results will provide strategies for the sustainable development of China's banking industry and the implementation of changes in response to the impact of the Fintech revolution. © 2019 by the authors.","China's banking industry; DANP; DEMATEL; Fintech; Hybrid MCDM model; Modified VIKOR; Service innovation strategy","banking; business development; competition (economics); decision making; financial market; financial services; innovation; laboratory method; China",,,,,"Gomber, P., Kauffman, R.J., Parker, C., Weber, B.W., On the Fintech revolution: Interpreting the forces of innovation, disruption and transformation in financial services (2018) J.

Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Actualization; Blockchain; Case study; Experimentation; FinTech; Organizational affordances","Information systems; Actualization; Affordances; Experimentation; FinTech; Information technology implementations; Potential impacts; Strategic impacts; Strategic information systems; Blockchain",,,,,"Abraham, C., Junglas, I., From cacophony to harmony: a case study about the IS implementation process as an opportunity for organizational transformation at Sentara Healthcare (2011) J.

The main problem in innovation implementation is the evaluation of the effectiveness of the innovative project. The challenger bank is not just a financial institution but also an information and communication company. It allows presenting these banks in the form of information and communication system and applies the methodology of evaluation of IT projects. Basing on this assumption, a mathematical model was built to evaluate the effectiveness of this bank as an information project. On the basis of which a study was conducted on the dependence of net discounted income on changes in the number of customers of challenger bank and the number of banking operations carried out by them. The modeling resulted that this form of credit institution will be effective if the customer base crosses the line of two hundred and ten thousand people in the first year. © 2019 IEEE","Challenger banks; Cost-effectiveness; Financial institutions; Information technology management","Cost effectiveness; Challenger banks; Efficiency evaluation; Financial institution; Information and communication; Information and communication systems; Information projects; Information technology management; Innovation implementation; Finance",,,,,"Schumpeter, J.A., (2017) Theory of Economic Development, , Routledge; Cypher, J., (2014) The Process of Economic Development, , Routledge; Amin, A., An institutionalist perspective on regional economic development (2017) Economy, pp. 59-72. , Routledge, -; Klochkov, Y., Odinokov, S., Klochkova, E., Ostapenko, M., Volgina, A., Development of certification model (2016) 5th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization, ICRITO 2016: Trends and Future Directions; Buchak, G., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) Journal of Financial Economics, 130 (3), pp. 453-483. , -. - №. -; Dapp, T., Fintech-The digital evolution in the financial sector (2014) Deutsche Bank Research, , Frankfurt am Main; Bofondi, M., Gobbi, G., The big promise of FinTech (2017) European Economy, (2), pp. 107-119. , №. -; Nikolova, L.V., Rodionov, D.G., Bahauovna, M.A., Securitization of bank assets as a source of financing the innovation activity (2016) International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues; Vives, X., The impact of FinTech on banking (2017) European Economy, (2), pp. 97-105. , №. -; Rodionov, D., Rudskaia, I., Degtereva, V., Regional foresight as a technology for development of the regional innovation system (2017) Proceedings of the 29th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Education Excellence and Innovation Management Through Vision 2020: From Regional Development Sustainability to Global Economic Growth; Philippon, T., (2016) The Fintech Opportunity, , National Bureau of Economic Research; Cortina, L.J.J., Schmukler, S.L., The fintech revolution: A threat to global banking?

We analyzed the similarities and differences between Korean and Chinese users in Fintech usage intention. The previous literatures have been interested in finding and measuring the Fintech service quality. In this paper, a new model is proposed to explain usage intention focused on user’s personal and psychological characteristics. At the first part of study, the various theories related to Fintech service usage intention were introduced and compared with. A new model tried to examine the factors that can cause psychological discomfort of the users. The status quo bias, subjective norm and perceived risk are considered as major psychological discomfort factors. This study will guide Fintech companies to carry out an effective Fintech service strategy. The key data, especially, on Fintech usage intention of Korean and Chinese users will help multi-national companies to formulate the differentiated strategies reflecting each country’s consumer psychology. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019.","Fintech service; Innovativeness; Self-efficacy; Status quo bias; Usage intention",,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitude and Predicting Social Behavior, Prentice-Hall, pp. 20-25. , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Dowling, G.R., Staelin, R., A model of perceived risk and intended risk-handling activity (1994) Journal of Consumer Research, 21, pp. 119-134; Gao, X., Kim, M.S., A study on perceived characteristics of mobile payment system and continuous usage intention (2018) International Journal of Wireless and Mobile Communication for Industrial Systems, 5 (2), pp. 1-6; Han, K.S., Park, J.K., The application of the Theory of Reasoned Action to nursing (1994) The Spirit of the Society, 3 (2), pp. 47-53; Hwang, J., Hong, S.Y., Park, J.K., A study of factors affecting the intention to use a mobile easy payment service: An integrated extension of TAM with perceived risk (2016) Journal of Information Technology and Architecture, 13 (2), pp. 291-306; Jeong, G.S., A study on activation measures of local mobile easy-to-use payment (2015) Convergence Security Journal, 15 (4), pp. 22-24; Kim, H.B., Young, Y.J., Lee, Z.H., The influence of perceived risk, subjective norm of overseas travel on attitudes and behavioral intentions: Application of Theory of Reasoned Action (2012) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Studies, 14 (1), pp. 67-81; Kim, H.W., Kankanhalli, A., Investigating user resistance to information systems implementation: A status quo bias perspective (2009) MIS Quarterly, 33 (3), pp. 567-582; Lee, H.L., Kim, J.W., Sung, B.C., Choi, Y.J., Park, J.K., A study on self-efficacy difference between user and non-user of smartphone (2013) Journal of the Korea Society of Computer and Information, 18 (2), pp. 157-164; Oh, J.Y., Choi, B.W., The influence of innovativeness on use of SNS and the role of mediating effects of identity expressiveness (2013) The E-Business Studies, 14 (2), pp. 179-197; Shaw, N., The mediating influence of trust in the adoption of the mobile wallet (2014) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Service, 21 (4), pp. 449-459; Suh, M.S., Kim, S.H., A study on the relationship of internet shopping mall characteristics and emotional responses (2002) Korea Marketing Review, 17 (2), pp. 113-145; Sung, K., Convenience and safety of Fintech payments: Tokenization (2015) Communications of the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineer, 33 (5), pp. 13-16; Taylor, J.W., The role of risk on consumer behavior (1974) The Journal of Marketing, 38, pp. 54-60; Yang, S.H., Hwang, Y.S., Park, J.K., A study on the use of Fintech payment services based on the UTAUT Model (1997) Journal of Management & Economics, 38 (1), pp. 183-209","Kim, M.-S.email: kms@gw.kmu.ac.kr",,,"Rushing Water Publishers Ltd.",,,,,01173375,,,,"English","Asia Life Sci.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062647133

To appreciate these changes, it is important to maintain theoretical interchange between developments in financial geography and economic geography, its parent discipline. In this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrow’s geographies of Fintech. Through an in-depth examination of Brussels, we analyse the potential of Fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services. Belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and Brussels’ existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing. The latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players SWIFT and Euroclear. We analyse how Belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess Brussels’ locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a Fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a Fin-Tech-State triangle. As such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice. © The Author(s) 2019.","Belgium; Brussels; digitization; economic geography; ecosystem; financial centres; financial geography; Fintech; innovation systems; strategic coupling",,,,,,"Aalbers, M.B., Financial geography: Introduction to the virtual issue (2015) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 40 (2), pp. 300-305; Amin, A., Thrift, N.J., Neo-Marshallian nodes in global networks (1992) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 16 (4), pp. 571-587; Amin, A., Thrift, N.J., (1994) Globalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, , Oxford, Oxford University Press, (eds; Asheim, B.T., Boschma, R.A., Cooke, P., Constructing regional advantage: Platform policies based on related variety and differentiated knowledge bases (2011) Regional Studies, 45 (7), pp. 893-904. , (, a; Asheim, B.T., Smith, H.L., Oughton, C., Regional innovation systems: Theory, empirics and policy (2011) Regional Studies, 45 (7), pp. 875-891. , (, b; Auerswald, P.E., Dani, L., Economic ecosystems (2018) The New Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography, pp. 245-269. , Clark G.L., Feldman M., Gertler M., Wójcik D., (eds), Oxford, Oxford University Press, In:, (eds; Barnes, T., Peck, J., Sheppard, E., Methods matter: Transformations in economic geography (2007) Politics and Practice in Economic Geography, pp. 1-24. , Tickell A., Sheard E., Peck J., Barnes T., (eds), Los Angeles, Sage,.

The main method of research is a sociological survey on the level of use of financial technologies in the Republic of Tajikistan. In addition, we used the methods of systematization, generalization and graphical presentation of the data to analyze the results of the survey. The levels of use of financial technologies by men and women were compared; it has been found that they vary significantly. In addition, there is a gap in the understanding and use of financial technologies depending on the place of residence (urban/rural). The expansion of digital financial services can, therefore, identify opportunities for continuation and challenges that need to be addressed in promoting women's financial inclusion and economic empowerment. © 2019 GEA College â€“ Faculty of Entrepreneurship.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by financial institutions’ business. This study involved rural banks, commercial banks, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by net loan to assets while profit was assessed by return on assets. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after financial technology startups emerged. The study reveals that financial technology startups disrupt financial institutions’ business and performance because their total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural banks and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of financial technology startups does not occur in commercial banks. © 2019, Society for Alliance, Fidelity and Advancement (SAFA).

India, however, remain at a very low on the index of clean countries in the world. The causes for lack of proper hygienic conditions in India are many like poverty of the people, low level of literacy, cultural & religious customs of different groups etc. Due to the uncleanliness of the places, the Indian public is subjected to many diseases and discomforts. Even after seven decades of attaining independence, the situation has not changed for better. Realizing the importance of cleanliness in the country, the Government of India launched a special initiative called ``Swachha Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) under the aegis of Ministry of drinking water & sanitation on 2nd October, 2014 commemorating the birth day of the Father of the Nation. The campaign has attracted many stakeholders like State Governments, NGOs, Corporates of Public and Private sectors. The aim is to make India a clean country by 2019. This is the biggest behavioral change initiative taken by the Government in post independent era. ONGC, a Maharatna company and Numero Uno of public sector companies in India has also drawn numerous programmes in line with the mission of ``Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’’. (Clean India Campaign). It has been contributing generously towards the cause of Swachh Bharat through its fund meant for the Corporate Social Responsibility. ONGC has framed its own CSR and Sustainability Policy from 1st April, 2014. Around 30% of the CSR budget of ONGC, every year, is earmarked for ``Swachh Bharat’’ alone. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

This paper was conducted with the purpose of determining the effect of fintech including services e-payment, bills e-payment, ways of payment and bank accounts with e-government on facilitating e-government services in terms of availability, accessibility, efficiency and responsiveness. Research design, data, and methodology - The problem of this paper is summarized in the lack of studies in this subject. So, a survey was applied on 400 respondents in Egypt to investigate the impact of fintech on facilitating e-government services, in order to determine which fintech item can affect any of facilitating services dimensions. Results - The results revealed that bank accounts with e-government doesn't affect any of facilitating services dimension, while each of the remain items has an effect on some dimensions and does not has effect on others. Conclusions - Data analysis revealed that the most obstacles that face respondents resulted in the weakness of internet networks, lack of efficient employees in e-government portal and lack of system effectiveness. In general, it clears that fintech implementation affect the dimensions of facilitating e-government services, however not all fintech implementation components have the same effect on the dimensions. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).","Egyptian e-government; Financial technology; Fintech in e-government; ICT in e-government",,,,,,"Abdel-kader, M., Requirements of establishing banking technology in supporting competitive intelligence in Algerian banks (2013) Journal Academic for social and human studies, 50 (2), pp. 23-30; Alderete, M.V., The mediating role of ICT in the development of open government (2018) Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 21 (3), pp. 172-187; Almarabeh, T., AbuAli, A., A General Framework for E-Government: Definition Maturity Challenges, Opportunities, and Success (2010) European Journal of Scientific Research, 39 (1), pp. 29-42; Azab, N., Ali, M., Dafoulas, G., Incorporating CRM in E-Government: Case of Egypt (2006) Proceedings of the IADIS International Conference e-Commerce, LADIS; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anticorruption tools for societies (2010) Government Information Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 264-271; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., An empirical examination of the antecedents and consequences of contribution patterns in crowd-funded markets (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (3), pp. 499-519; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., Cultural differences and geography as determinants of online prosocial lending (2014) Management Information Systems Quarterly, 38 (3), pp. 773-794; Basic Terminology (2016) Alliance for Financial Inclusion [AFI], 19, p. 10; Ebbers, W.E., Jansen, M.G., Van Deursen, A.J., Impact of the digital divide on e-government: Expanding from channel choice to channel usage (2016) Government information quarterly, 33 (4), pp. 685-692; Foster, C., Heeks, R., Innovation and scaling of ICT for the bottom-of-the-pyramid (2013) Journal of Information Technology, 28 (4), pp. 296-315; Gebba, T., Zakaria, M., E-Government in Egypt: An Analysis of Practices and Challenges (2015) International Journal of Business Research and Development, 4 (2), pp. 11-25; Heeks, R., Information systems and developing countries: Failure, success, and local improvisations (2002) Information Society, 18 (2), pp. 101-112; Leong, C., Tan, B., Xiao, X., Tan, F.T., Sun, Y., Nurturing a FinTech ecosystem: The case of a youth microloan startup in China (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (2), pp. 92-97; Leong, K., Sung, A., FinTech (Financial Technology): What is It and How to Use Technologies to Create Business Value in Fintech Way?

This circumstance is particularly relevant in the case of the tourism sector, which has been able to adopt and adapt information and communication technologies (ICT) to its processes with greater anticipation. Technological progress and the massive use of information and communication technologies have allowed the optimization of activities carried out by Iraqi companies, be they public, private or of any kind. This advance has increased the use of ICT, particularly in the provision of services, which are trying to solve many and varied problems. Each year researchers talk with tech leaders about the biggest problems they'll face in the near future, where organizations in the current era are facing major challenges due to technological progress and competition on the worldwide web . This requires the use of administrative policies with advanced financial technology to improve strategic performance and competition. This is the purpose of this research, which employed a set of policies and administrative practices using financial technology that have been proven through studies and researches on its effectiveness and how to employ this in improving strategic performance and competition. The research was conducted by sampling 319 respondents within the tourism industry through the use of a structured questionnaire. The results of each respondent's responses were measured using a Likert scale. The results were obtained from the PLS and the structural equation modelling method. The study concluded that these tools required a set of powers to attract financial technology that can contribute to improving strategic performance. © 2019 AJHTL.","E-controlling; E-execution; E-organizing; E-planning; Fintech; PLS",,,,,,"Agbeja, O., Adelakun, O.J., Akinyemi, D., Analysis of the Effect of Advertising on Sales and Profitability of Company (2015) International Journal of Novel Research in Marketing Management and Economics, 2 (3), pp. 81-90; Al Shobaki, M.J., Abu-Naser, S.S., Amuna, Y.M.A., El Talla, S.A., (2018) Support Extent Provided by Universities Senior Management in Assisting the Transition to e-Management; Al-Dhubaibi, S., Abdullah, A., (2016) The effects of management accounting practices on firm performance: antecedent factors and the role of managerial functions/Ahmed Abdullah Saad Al-Dhubaibi, , (Doctoral dissertation, Universiti Teknologi MARA); Amanchukwu, R.N., Stanley, G.J., Ololube, N.P., A review of leadership theories, principles and styles and their relevance to educational management (2015) Management, 5 (1), pp. 6-14; Androwis, N., Sweis, R.J., Tarhini, A., Moarefi, A., Hosseini Amiri, M., Total quality management practices and organizational performance in the construction chemicals companies in Jordan (2018) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 25 (8), pp. 3180-3205; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of Fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, p. 1271; Baird, K., Jia Hu, K., Reeve, R., The relationships between organizational culture, total quality management practices and operational performance (2011) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 31 (7), pp. 789-814; Bryson, J.M., (2018) Strategic planning for public and nonprofit organizations: A guide to strengthening and sustaining organizational achievement, , John Wiley & Sons; Bulej, L., Bures, T., Horky, V., Keznikl, J., Tuma, P., Performance awareness in component systems: Vision paper (2012) 2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops, pp. 514-519. , July.

Most banks have acknowledged the importance of new technologies to improve performance and client satisfaction. The development of these innovations has led to the entrance of the so-called Fintechs. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of these transformations on the performance of financial institutions and on their business model. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data envelopment analysis and Malmquist total productivity indices to measure financial institutions’ efficiency and their influence on strategy. Findings: The main finding is that clients are more than ever at the core of banking strategy. The irrelevance of distance in basic banking transactions has reduced expenses and contributed to increasing revenues for all financial institutions. Banks will have a card to play in the advice they can bring to their clients. Practical implications: This research could be of interest for financial managers who wish to re-examine their current business practices and imagine their business model for the future. Originality/value: The contribution will be to further define the correlation between the provision of electronic banking services and its performance by including diversified institutions (conventional banks, Fintechs, Gafas) in the sample from multiple geographic zones to identify differences as regards their efficiency and business practices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banks; Business strategy; Digitalization; Fintechs; Gafas; Innovation; Performance",,,,,,"Berger, A.N., Humphrey, D.B., Efficiency of financial institutions: international survey and directions for future research (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 98 (2), pp. 175-212; Bhutani, S., Paliwal, Y., Digitalization: a step towards sustainable development (2015) OIDA International Journal of Sustainable Development, 8 (12), pp. 11-24; Boyd, J.H., Gertler, M., Are banks dead?

In this regard, regulatory sandboxes, which were recently introduced in several jurisdictions, provide a promising solution, as they imply a liberalization of regulatory requirements in order to enable FinTechs to test their innovative services. However, we observe that no comparable initiative exists in Germany, even though the German regulator identified a need for action on this subject in order to maintain its international competitiveness. Thus, based on a detailed analysis of various sandbox models worldwide, this paper develops a set of own recommendations as a basis for the implementation of a sandbox concept which might be applicable in the German regulatory environment. In doing so, we identify current theoretical as well as practical regulatory issues within the context of the rapid FinTech evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first study on key international sandboxes as a basis to design guidelines specifically for the German financial market. Thereby, we contribute to the literature as we evolve an effective regulation within the new setting of innovative financial technologies. Moreover, our findings contribute to the practical solution of current challenges faced by both regulators and affected companies. Even though our derived implications focus on the German financial sector, the results may potentially be applicable in further jurisdictions with similar regulatory requirements. © 2019, Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

With the use of techniques borrowed from grounded theory, we analyze material from 10 interviews with managers and Chief Executive Officers at FinTechs and 8 interviews with venture capitalists (VCs). We examined 15 critical success factors (CSFs) for FinTech ventures. These are divided into 9 factors that generally apply to general ventures: (1) team, (2) entrepreneur, (3) capital, (4) product/market fit, (5) idea and execution, (6) pivoting and continuous learning, (7) customer acquisition, (8) internationalization, and (9) networking. In addition, we examine 6 factors that have specific relevance to FinTech venture success, namely, (10) technological advantage, (11) regulatory knowledge, (12) B2B focus, (13) incumbent partnerships, (14) growth potential, and (15) exit options for VCs. Our study expands the literature on CSFs for FinTechs and provides recommendations for entrepreneurs to be more successful. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

The purpose of this article is to understand the service innovation approach of FinTech companies. The complexities of service innovation are explained with a theoretical concept of service innovation stack, which presents the multiple components needed for successful service innovation. The usefulness of this construct is observed with a longitudinal case study of 10 FinTech startup from Finland using interviews and other data. These are shown with a visual representation, which ties in the internal activities with the external ones and shows the interplay between them. With the representation of the service innovation stack, the service innovation within financial industry can be better understood and further developed. The authors further suggest that though the framework is based on cases from FinTech startups, it might be relevant also for the incumbents.

These technologies create market segments which are small initially and have not been targeted by the existing companies. Startups are leveraging these types of innovations and are giving tough fight to the traditional organizations. These organizations need to project themselves as the technology leaders, else there is a constant threat for them to be thrown out of the market by new disruptors. This paper investigates technology used by a startup which has the potential to disrupt existing business models. This paper adopts a case-based approach which is a startup along with specific comparison with those organizations which are still relying on traditional methods. For comparison purpose, Paytm is taken as the subject which is leveraging on digital technologies to break the conventional practices followed by brick and mortar banking system. Analysis is done on how Paytm has grown in an accelerated manner by taking advantage of penetration of financial services in India. Favourable ecosystems in the form of government support and markets available in countries like India has definitely fuelled the growth of Paytm. Research also analyses the funding opportunities which have been tapped by Paytm from giant foreign investors like Alibaba group, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway. These disruptors do not rely only on opportunity discovery, but also on opportunity creation. They work on combining discovery and creation to tap wide range of possibilities. For example, Paytm has become a synonym for online money transactions.

Technology offers South African banks the opportunity to address inherent socio-economic imbalances in the economy. However, the potential systemic risk it poses threatens to aggravate the situation if it not properly regulated. This paper uses a non-positivist, qualitative research design - the case study approach - to argue that South African banks have adopted a measured mindset to adopting Fintech because they are fundamentally risk-averse. Structural socio-economic imbalances, legacy systems, and a banking industry that has traditionally been conservative are argued to be the main drivers of this. The findings posited by this paper are intended to sensitise policymakers to the thinking of South African banks when formulating policies that address developments in Fintech in the future. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

The transition to digitalization of the financial sector is accompanied by a fundamentally new, qualitative transformation of socioeconomic relations in society. Design/Methodology/Approach: As part of the study, the concept of FinTech was considered both in the context of technological innovation and in the context of companies utilizing these innovations in business, as well as the systematization of business models of the FinTech industry. The classification of horizontal and vertical innovations of the financial industry is given. The authors presented the structure of the FinTech ecosystem as an instrument for ensuring sustainable. Findings: For the successful development of the FinTech ecosystem, the authors of the study presented a number of initiatives, the implementation of which will ensure the maintenance of the financial system stability, protection of consumer rights, as well as the digital innovations’ development and implementation. Practical Implications: The formation of a sustainable digital financial infrastructure tends to ensure the effective provision of services in the financial market, including for small and medium-sized companies, which will increase the availability of financial services and promote competition in the financial sector. Originality/Value: The key contribution of the study is the ecosystem approach, which allowed determining the possibilities of safe sustainable development of the financial sector. © 2019 International Strategic Management Association.

The cashless system is not just a necessity but also a need of today’s order. Over the past few years, efforts to drive financial inclusion in India have delivered mixed results. Access to bank accounts has increased dramatically, driven by a strong policy and regulatory push. However, the usage of these accounts and the uptake of formal financial services beyond savings accounts has remained exceptionally difficult. The recent initiatives by the Government around demonetization and the move to cashless transactions will further drive innovation and new entrants into the Indust ry. The amendment s to the banking act clearly demonst rate the Government, RBI and Banking institutions intent to ensure stable growth of the economy by ensuring a healthy BFSI. Building Trust within the industry will be paramount to India’s further growth. Newer technologies pose different challenges to the banks and regulators, with security being a key concern. With cyber-frauds on the rise, the regulators and the bankers would have to come together to ensure control mechanisms are in place. A strong push from the Government of India has given the non-banking population easy access to financial products. Payment organizations have demonstrated the advantages of mobile-led solutions and the traditional banking organizations are now trying to make inroads into rural India by launching innovative mobile-based banking solutions. With support from the government, large technology companies are using new ways of reaching out to the rural masses and educate them about the various financial products, thus ensuring that their hard-earned income is rightly invested. © 2019, Ashwin Anokha Publications and Distributors.

The business has started to utilize advanced internet-based technology. Gojek and Grab have both joined the competition by introducing GO-PAY and OVO as their crucial features in their applications. Both Gojek and Grab have succeeded in countering conventional means of transport and taken over the dominations of services to clients. The term of fintech has been optimized in day-to-day operations, however the figures of capitalization are different significantly indicating the number of loyal customers. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to spot the main causes, a problem illustrated by intention to use and considering the usefulness and also ease of use the applications. Eighty-two of Diploma degree students were asked to complete a set of TAM-questionnaires, and answer which applications they use the most.

Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in the philosophical foundations of “use-inspired research,” this paper addresses the managerially and societally relevant phenomenon of Fintech by identifying, and responding to, the individual challenges and problems associated with the digital transformation of financial services. This is accomplished through a computational text-mining approach to analyze the corpus of 1,545 published practitioner articles associated with Fintech, identification of managerial challenges therein and subsequent delineation of a novel research agenda. Findings: By connecting managerial challenges relating to Fintech with the service literature, this paper develops a use-inspired research agenda that provides scholarly and managerially relevant research directions (RDs). These pertain to the complexity of digital financial service systems (micro level), orchestration of value co-creation with Fintech (meso level), and the development of elastic infrastructures, models and markets (macro level). Research limitations/implications: Fintech is an emerging phenomenon associated with the digital transformation of financial services. However, actual guidelines on how service research related to Fintech could be advanced from a theoretically as well as managerially relevant angle are unavailable to date. Here, the authors address this challenge and provide the field with 18 tangible RDs to advance service theory and practice. Practical implications: The purpose of this paper is to guide future academic research addressing managerial challenges associated with Fintech and the digital transformation of financial service. Due to the explicit use-inspired nature of the work, the future research stemming from the agenda that the authors put forward here will be of benefit to decision makers and society more broadly. Originality/value: This empirical research contributes to the discourse regarding the role of information and communication technologies in service in general, and the digital transformation on financial services in particular. The in-depth computational text-mining analysis is unbiased, replicable and provides the foundation for a use-inspired research agenda that is subsequently delineated. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital transformation; Financial service systems; Fintech; Text mining",,,,,,"Antons, D., Breidbach, C.F., Big data, big insights?

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used to identify risk factors related to the use of new financial innovations, by examining how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contributed to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) which occurred during 2007 and 2008. Based on this analysis, the potential for similar concerns with smart contracts are evaluated, drawing on the failure of The DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, which involved the loss of over $60m of digital currency. Findings: Extensive use of bilateral agreements, complexity and lack of standardization, lack of transparency, misuse and speed of contagion were factors that contributed to the GFC that could also become material concerns for smart contract technology as its adoption grows. These concerns, combined with other contextual factors, such as the risk of defects in smart contracts and cyberattacks, could lead to potential destabilization of the broader financial system. Practical implications: The paper’s findings provide insights to help make the design, management and monitoring of smart contract technology more robust. They also provide guidance for key stakeholders on proactive steps that can be taken with smart contract technology to avoid repeating the types of oversights that contributed to the GFC. Originality/value: This paper draws attention to the risks associated with the adoption of disruptive FinTech. It also suggests steps that regulators and other key stakeholders can take to help mitigate those risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Digital currencies; Distributed ledger technology;

Initially, few structures were developed to help cater to the attention of the Islamic financial industry players involved in peer-to-peer dealings. The new trend of the technological evolution in the banking and financial sector has proved to be the next challenge in this sector. However, the survival of Islamic fintech will heavily rely on the existing established trust within the sector. The potential collaborations between the established Islamic banks, fintech players and start-ups will certainly unleash the potentials of today’s technologies in the Islamic finance industry. Being in their early stages, Malaysia and its counterparts from the GCC states have the potentials to becoming leaders in the Islamic fintech industry and may work together to develop a necessary framework for Islamic fintech advancement. Peer-to-peer arrangement connects crowdfunding investors with entrepreneurs through more transparency, speed dealings and almost free from complications in the documentation. In view of the fact that mushārakah is becoming more practical under the concept of Islamic peer-to-peer deals, this paper attempts to develop a new peer-to-peer financing which is underlain by the Mushārakah Smart Contract Model. The paper proposes a mushārakah model using Mushārakah Smart Contract in which the investors would be crediting their investments for mushārakah purposes with virtual lenders for specific Sharīʽah compliant businesses and share in the profit, based on an agreed dividend under the mushārakah principles. It also highlights the potential structures, cyber risks, and devices to mitigate them by using mushārakah standards and measures within the Sharīʽah principles. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

The services offered by FinTech differ widely, but all share some commonalities. As FinTech is a growing service sector, there is a need to check the service quality offered by the different service providers. The study was conducted on Islamic banks of Malaysia and UAE which offer Fintech services to their customers. A 26-item questionnaire was used to gather data from 325 customers by strata sampling. Statistical data was analysed through various tests like reliability analysis, sample adequacy, factor analysis and regression analysis using SPSS 25.0. Shariah compliance variable was added to the e-SERVQUAL model to make it relevant for Islamic banks. This study found that Shariah compliance information, site aesthetic, efficient and reliable services, and fulfilment of promises and transaction has a significant impact on the customer satisfaction in Islamic banks for the FinTech services offered.

If the ambition of FinTech start-ups to create superior screening and monitoring technologies materialises, this advantage would be diminished and regional banks would become superfluous for small firm finance. To explore this claim, the paper in hand analyses qualitative empirical data about the lending processes and rating system use of regional German savings banks. In essence, the results from participant observation and interviews clarify the importance of “real” soft information for critical lending decisions. The context specificity and limited verifiability of “real” soft information hamper it from being hardened through the use of rating systems and other bank-ICT. Though FinTech's scoring technologies may overcome the first limitation, it appears likely that in the course of scoring development “real” soft information will be systematically crowded out due to the manipulation problem. The paper expects improved access to finance for SMEs if FinTech solutions overcome both limitations of “real” soft information use, or if peer-to-peer lending and regional banks coexist. Deteriorated access to finance is expected if FinTech companies displace the relationship banking of regional banks due to enhanced competition, without preserving the advantages of “real” soft information with superior screening and monitoring technologies. The paper concludes with recommendations on how to prevent deteriorated access to finance for small firms by promoting fair competition and FinTech innovations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","FinTech; peer-to-peer lending; regional banks; relationship banking; small firm finance; soft information",,,,,,"Agarwal, S., Hauswald, R., (2007) Distance and information asymmetries in lending decisions, , https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/2006/oct/hauswald.pdf, (Proceedings from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago No 2052).

As one of the most regulated sectors in Turkish economy, financial services are far from being ignored. FinTech companies in Turkey have been developing innovative products and services that provide great value for consumers and businesses. Fast pace of development in areas based on electronic services such as e-invoice, e-payments, e-government services, importance of FinTechs have become more apparent with their agility in taking action and offering innovative services. However, as agile as they might be, FinTech companies tend to ignore the regulations which financial institutions are subject to. ""If it works here, it works everywhere"" approach may have a serious downside when it comes to execution stage. From definition of the service to areas of application, to formation of the company and background of the investors, the ever-dictating financial sector regulations change dramatically from one country to another. As in the example of popular payment provider PayPal, failing to keep primary systems domestically may lead to a rejection of license application from BRSA (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency) [1] Another example of such regulations is the need to do Due Diligence and monitor suspicious customer activity for AML/CTF purposes for some FinTechs in payment industry. Such requirements can be daunting for a technology-oriented point of view, and many of these companies face these facts at a later stage when they try to coexist or collaborate with other financial institutions. As these requirements may alter operational costs, human resources, and even IT infrastructure, they struggle to find investment or sign contracts with financial institutions. This study covers both successful and unsuccessful FinTech projects in payments and their position against regulations and offer remediations for better acceptance within Turkish financial sector. © 2019 The Authors.

In this research, we are aiming to draw a framework by using business experience in Kuveyt Türk Participation Bank in Turkey to give guidance to other financial institutions in Fintech Integration Process. This study contains entire fintech Integration Process from revealing the needs of the internal departments to the completion of fintech integration. We divided Fintech Integration Process into seven phases. First phase, collecting needs of internal departments. Second phase consist of scouting relevant fintechs around the world by using databases and online platforms. Third phase, fintech makes presentation for introduction and explains its business model. At the end of this meeting, relevant bank employees evaluate the presentation and decide whether to invite fintech again for Business Committee or not. Fourth phase, fintech enters Business Committee to make presentation for Vice Presidents of the relevant departments. Fifth phase, fintech meets with IT, compliance and legal departments to discuss and solve problems. In sixth phase, senior management makes decision to start POC (Proof of Concept) process. Lastly, in seventh phase, fintech integration comes alive for the customer use. All these phases are constructed to mitigate risks and increase awareness of fintechs in the departments. In this way, most of the departments get in touch with fintechs and understand the importance of external collaboration. © 2019 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors review two Chinese entrepreneurial practices in the Fintech sector and low-speed electric vehicles (LSEV) and describe their stylized facts; second, they explore a possible theoretical LTM framework to underscore these practices; third, they make a connection between LTM and existing business models and analyze its significance and practical implications in business, in particular, in developing economies. Findings: The LTM business approach has helped Chinese companies in the Fintech sector and LSEVs gain global attention. The success factors of LTM for businesses are identifying a specific customer base, being aware of localization products and playing skillfully with regulations; the LTM approach has several overlaps with existing studies on niche products and base of the pyramid market. Originality/value: Based on some emerging and attractive business practices in China, this paper offers a valuable attempt to theorize them as long tail phenomenon. The LTM thesis provides a potential framework to reference for similar methods elsewhere and may illuminate entrepreneurship to be explored in similar markets. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fintech; Long tail markets; Low-speed electric vehicles",,,,,,"Anderson, C., The long tail (2004) Wired Magazine, pp. 170-177; Armendáriz, B., Morduch, J., (2010) The Economics of Microfinance, , 2nd ed., The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, and London; Baker, T.H., (2017) FinTech alternatives to short-term small-dollar credit: helping low-income working families escape the high-cost lending trap, , www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp75; Barzilay, O., Geva, H., Goldstein, A., Oestreicher-Singer, G., (2018) Equal opportunity for all?

As applications, our discussion in this paper for the illustration of some issues and problems on the stability of mining pool-games for miners by applying consensus games shows that the concept of consensus equilibria could be used as a fundamental tool for the study of consensus economics under the framework of Blockchain economy in Fintech. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.","Bitcoin ecosystem; Blockchain economy; Blockchain Protocol; Chain Fork; Consensus equilibrium; Consensus game; Fintech; Hybrid solutions; Longest chain rules (LCR); Minier dilemma; Mining economics; Multi-pools game; Nakamoto consensus; Nonordered preferences; Stability","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Convergence of numerical methods; Ecosystems; Machine design; Chain rules; Consensus game; Fintech; Hybrid solution; Minier dilemma; Mining economics; Multi-pool; Nakamoto consensus; Nonordered preferences; Game theory",,,,,"Askoura, Y., The weak-core of a game in normal form with a continuum of players (2011) J.

Some researchers blame it for disrupting financial ecosystem and while others admire it for redefining traditional business models. According to the Statista Report 2018, transaction value in the crowdfunding segment amounts to US$ 5,250 mn in 2018. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of FinTech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in Islamic banks of Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. A structured questionnaire consisting of 31 items was designed to gather data from 535 customers of selected banks from both countries through strata sampling. Various statistical tests were done to check the association between FinTech applications including crowdfunding and customer retention using SPSS 25.0. The results indicated that financing application of FinTech has no relevance to customer retention while as other variables such as payments, advisory services, compliance and crowdfunding has an impact on retaining customers in Islamic banks of these two countries. The conclusion of this study emphasis on expanding the range of applications of FinTech services by Islamic banks so that the customer will stay longer with the bank. Also, crowdfunding should be integrated into the Islamic banking system so that it can help in social entrepreneurship, micro-finance and establishing global Zakah and Sadaqa system. © 2019 Management Development Institute.","Customer Retention; FinTech; Islamic Banks; Malaysia; UAE",,,,,,"Abawajy, J., Wang, G., Yang, L.T., Javadi, B., Trust, security and privacy in emerging distributed systems (2016) Future Generation Computer Systems, 55 (C), pp. 224-226. , &; Agolla, J.E., Makara, T., Monametsi, G., Impact of banking innovations on customer attraction, satisfaction and retention: The case of commercial banks in Botswana (2018) International Journal of Electronic Banking, 1 (2), pp. 150-170. , &; Aisyah, M., Islamic bank service quality and its impact on Indonesian customers’ satisfaction and loyalty (2018) Al-Iqtishad Journal of Islamic Economics, 10 (2), pp. 367-388; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: A new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, p. 1271. , &; Ascarza, E., Neslin, S.A., Netzer, O., Anderson, Z., Fader, P.S., Gupta, S., Provost, F., In pursuit of enhanced customer retention management: Review, key issues, and future directions (2018) Customer Needs and Solutions, 5 (1-2), pp. 65-81. , …; Aveni, T., Jenik, I., (2017) Crowdfunding in China: The financial inclusion dimension, pp. 1-4. , https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/Brief-Crowdfunding-in-China-Jul-2017_0.pdf, Washington, DC, CGAP, &, (p., –,)., :, Retrieved from; Baber, H., How crisis-proof is Islamic finance?

The analysis is based on a country-level dataset covering the period of 2007–2017 and 107 countries. The results reveal that greater FinTech establishment intensity characterizes smaller countries, countries with stronger information and communications technology (ICT) services clusters, and countries that have experienced a crisis during the recent decade. Greater FinTech establishment intensity is also observed in countries with greater tertiary education enrolment rates, stronger university-industry cooperation, greater fixed line availability, and overall ICT readiness. The macroeconomic situation and indicators of financial development prove to be important determinants of FinTech formation. Given the importance of several dimensions of location’s diamond in FinTech formation, FinTech entrepreneurs could benefit from a careful analysis of the diamond of locations that they are considering as potential places of doing business. Countries hoping to become more attractive FinTech establishment sites, in turn, should focus on the elimination of weaknesses in the location’s diamond in close co-operation with FinTechs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","FinTechs; location; Porter’s diamond model; start-up establishment",,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Lehmann, E.E., The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (2013) Small Business Economics, 41 (4), pp. 757-774; Ahi, K., Laidroo, L., Banking Market Competition in Europe—Financial Stability or Fragility Enhancing?

Recent innovations in the FinTech sector has disrupted all aspects of finance, ranging from payments, lending, investments to insurance and other service areas. 67% of Indian financial institutions perceive FinTech as a powerful threat to their survival. The FinTech sector has witnessed increased participation from non-financial players such as telecom, power, and other industries. Emerging disruptive trends have proven that a large dataset can be effectively leveraged with total customer engagement and drastically lower investments in IT infrastructure. This paper provides a reflective view of the collective impact of the government digital policies and emerging disruptive technology in India. The paper examines the FinTech disruption formula and its relative implication on the financial services landscape by substituting financial products with IT applications which are cheaper, better and faster. The paper entails the unique case study of ‘India Stack’ aimed at creating a single financial ecosystem in India that is presence-less, paperless and cashless. The paper outlines the economic outcomes from the FinTech disruption and top tech trends such as blockchain technology and IoT, which shall dominate the financial services sector for 2020. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The complex is rapidly evolving, by the end of July 2018 there were about 1700 cryptoprojects globally. The cryptocomplex includes separate cryptosystems linked into a single network via cryptocurrencies trade. The article reveals economic nature and business models of the three largest and most famous cryptosystems – Bitcoin, Ethereum и Ripple, which are responsible for about 70% of the global cryptocomplex capitalization. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum try to create the alternative to the traditional financial system, Ripple proposes new cutting edge technological and effective decisions for the existing banking and payments systems. The authors show that the largest global private cryptosystem Bitcoin, whose goal is substitution of fiat money with bitcoin cryptocurrency, in reality is far away from the ideal system of distributed money, which automatically maintains deals between peers via the neutral computer code. Bitcoin, as well as other systems of cryptocurrencies, has inherent hierarchy and vivid monopoly effects. De-facto control over the Bitcoin functioning rests with the largest players, who replaced the central bank. These players are the main beneficiaries of recurrent rise in capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The strategic task of making bitcoin an alternative to fiat money as a mean of payments has failed. Due to the excessive price volatility bitcoin failed to become a worthy alternative to fiat money and traditional assets as a mean of saving for broad categories of investors. Ethereum and Ripple business models are weakly linked to the dynamics of cryptocurrencies development, serving these systems. Ethereum business model provides for maximization of incomes, rents and other benefits for the system creators from its extensive development. Ripple made an economic bet on selling its special digital solutions to traditional players in financial markets. The authors make a conclusion that cryptocurrencies effectively serve interests of the two clienteles. First are the pioneers of financial sector digitalization, including computer programmers, computer engineers, cryptography and game theory experts as well as venture investors working in parallel. Second are economic agents engaged into various illegal and criminal activities. The authors forecast that given the policies of financial markets regulators the pseudo anonymity of transactions in the sector of cryptocurrencies will cease to exist in the nearest future. © 2019 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

To enable management decision making easier, methodology for identification of possible microeconomic risks and their influence on the current activity and the whole business model of the company has to be shaped accordingly. The aim of this research is to find out what and how microeconomic factors affect business modelling of the FinTech companies. In this research the authors used a continuous comparative analysis method as well as content analysis method [1]. In interviews, experts were asked to assess the significance of specific microeconomic factors by using the Likert’s scale. As a result of the research, the difference of the influence as well as their dependencies and modifications on business modelling was determined.

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.","Bank; Banking; Financial market; Financial services; FinTech accelerators; FinTech company; Innovative financial technologies",,,,,,"Julapa, J., Lemieux, C., Do fintech lenders penetrate areas that are underserved by traditional banks?

Using survey data, we analyze which FinTech services households are likely to adopt. Our results indicate that a household's level of trust and comfort with new technologies, financial literacy, and overall transparency impact its propensity to switch to a FinTech. Specifically, households with low levels of trust, good financial education, and preference for transparency are characterized by a higher probability of adopting FinTech. In contrast, household price perceptions do not appear to significantly impact switching probability. © 2019","Digital banking; Financial services; FinTech (financial technology); Non-bank financial institutions; Switching behavior; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"Aldás-Manzano, J., Lassala-Navarré, C., Ruiz-Mafé, C., Sanz-Blas, S., The role of consumer innovativeness and perceived risk in online banking usage (2009) Int.

FinTechs are companies that combine technological and financial attributes in their business models. In recent years, the rise of FinTech has attracted much attention since they challenge incumbent financial service companies including the traditional banking model. Innovative FinTech Business Models are Bitcoin, Tag Cash, Oradian, Satago, Simple Tax, Transfer wise, Holvi and TRDATA able to become a success because they could reach out to a humungous Global market. However, the growth in FinTech industry has not spurred up only because of small-scale entrepreneurs; the role of major financial industries cannot be neglected in this regard. The entrepreneurs work at small-scale in the FinTech industry. They have the capacity to bear the risk of failure in a better way as compared to the major financial institutions. Financial institutions work entirely on public trust. They are highly regulated by the financial authorities in order to add up to their reliability. These financial institutions are answerable to the public for all their operations and therefore, they have to closely guard their investment choices. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

This study determines the level of profitability of companies before and after the emergence of FinTech products. The authors focused on companies that have launched FinTech products and published their financial reports. The study sample consisted of 17 FinTech products from 16 companies in Indonesia. The limited number of the sample was caused by not all of them having published its financial reports, while we have checked 157 FinTech companies. An event study approach using paired sample T-test is utilized. The period used in this study is four years, covering two years before and two years after the company launched FinTech products. Data were obtained from IDX, FinTech.id, and company web-pages. The results clearly showed that there was a significant influence on return on assets (ROA), but no significant difference in return on equity (ROE). This finding gives more contribution to the FinTech industry about the company’s profitability impact of launching FinTech product. © Wika Harisa Putri, Nurwiyanta Nurwiyanta, Sungkono Sungkono, Tia Wahyuningsih, 2019","Event study; FinTech; Indonesia; Profitability; ROA; ROE",,,,,,"(2015) Future of FinTech and Banking, , http://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-future-FinTech-banking.aspx, Retrieved from accessed on December 24, 2018; Alexander, C., (2001) Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis, , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/40646/, John Wiley & Sons; Alimirruchi, W., Kiswara, E., Analyzing operational and financial performance on the financial technology (FinTech) firm (2017) Case Study on Samsung Pay, , March.

However, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult. Part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants. Problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries. This Article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma. Specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals. Moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits. This Article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses. The Article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation. © 2018, Chris Brummer & Yesha Yadav.",,,,,,,"Chavez-Dreyfuss, G., Bitcoin hits another record high in March towards $20,000 (2017) Reuters, , https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-another-record-high-in-march-towards-20000-idUSKBN1E60PE, Dec. 12, 5:30 AM, https://perma.cc/JJ8F-WUA5; Jay Clayton, Chairman, Sec. & Exch.

However, lack of funding and limited distribution channels to reach customers are frequent problems faced by farmers to meet the level of sustainability. Agriculture's sustainability can be strengthened by allowing an innovation of services such as Financial Technology (FinTech), and digital marketplace. Digital marketplace with Fintech enabled might transform agriculture's business process into more sustainable in term of funding and distribution. FinTech offers farmers convenient ways of getting sources of funding through crowdfunding and digital payment system. Thus, digital marketplace can act as a platform for FinTech to integrate the innovative financial solution into broader agriculture's ecosystem. The study proposes a modelling digital marketplace with FinTech enabled especially crowdfunding and payment system in order to support agriculture's sustainability. The model connects all actors (farmers, landowners, investors, and consumers) into a platform that can promote transparency, empowerment, resourcefulness, and public engagement in agriculture. © 2019 The Authors.

Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation. The idea of adapted stochastic process is essential for the stabilizer, too.

Financial institutions are not unfamiliar with this tendency since they have the need to respond faster to the changes in their business environments. This is partly due to the new generation of financial technology (fintech) companies that have shown a significant difference in time to market and in speeding up software development. To compete with fintech companies, financial institutions are looking for improving their software development processes focusing on applying agile practices in a better way. This article presents a set of proposals to improve software development in the LHV Bank. The set of proposals has been determined through a literature review and interviews conducted in two leading financial institutions and two fintech companies. The analysis done allowed us to understand the best practices that are currently being applied, how they are implemented, and which ones are suitable for application in LHV Bank. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agile software development; Financial institutions; Fintech companies; Software process improvement","Computer software selection and evaluation; Finance; Process engineering; Agile software development; Agile software process; Business environments; Financial institution; Industrial sector; Literature reviews; Software development process; Software Process Improvement; Software design",,,,,"Beck, K., (2001) Manifesto for Agile Software Development; Couzens, J., Implementing an enterprise system at Suncorp using agile development (2009) Australian Software Engineering Conference: ASWEC 2009, 20, pp. 35-39; Dingsøyr, T., Nerur, S., Balijepally, V., Moe, N.B., A decade of agile methodologies: Towards explaining agile software development (2012) J.

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast and local decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the learned information to future generations. This structure has been applied and validated in Fintech, a Bitcoin Smart Investment application based in an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk. Our results are promising; we have connected the human brain and genetics with Machine Learning based on the Random Neural Network model where Artificial Intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Bitcoin; Deep learning clusters; Fintech; Genetic learning; Random neural network; Reinforcement learning; Smart investment","Brain; Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Electronic money; Genes; Genetic algorithms; Information management; Investments; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Bitcoin; Fintech; Future generations; Genetic learning; Learning managements; Learning structure; Random neural network; Strategic decisions; Learning algorithms",,,,,"Kirschner, M., Gerhart, J., (2005) The Plausibility of Life Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma, , Yale University Press, New Haven; Parter, M., Kashtan, N., Alon, U., Facilitated Variation: How Evolution Learns from Past Environments To Generalize to New Environments (2008) Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science; Hinton, G., Nowlan, S., (1996) How Learning Can Guide Evolution.

In an environment where a FinTech payment service provider (FPP) covers only the front-end services, delegating the back-end services to an integrated payment service provider (IPP) such as banks and credit card companies, we show that under the IPP liability regime, the IPP invests more in general, while the respective investment depends on the range of the access fee under the FPP liability regime. Specifically, given a sufficiently great loss from accident, if the access fee is in a certain range, the FPP liability regime is superior in terms of antifraud investment. When the FPP makes its indirect revenue from its user base in addition to the revenue from user fees, we can observe greater antifraud investment under both liability regimes, but the overall decrease in fraud probability is higher under the IPP liability regime.

One such piece of legislation is the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which intends to further define a common legal framework for the payment market in the European Economic Area, with the aim of increasing the level of integration and efficiency in the market, as well as increasing the level of consumer protection. In this context, the enhancement of collaborative infrastructures can be the keystone to anticipate and transform the challenges of PSD2 into opportunities. This paper describes the creation of an open banking platform, called CBI Globe — Global Open Banking Ecosystem, to facilitate the interconnection between banks and third parties through application programming interfaces, in line with the new directive. Using this platform, adhering parties will be able to simplify and expedite the administration of current accounts by offering both reporting and payment and collection services, thus exploiting the business opportunities enabled by PSD2. © Henry Stewart Publications.","APIs; Berlin Group; CBI Globe; FinTechs; Open banking; PSD2; RegTech; TPP",,,,,,"(2017) 2017 Q3 2017 Fintech Insights, , https://www.ftpartners.com/fintech-research/almanac, (accessed 20th November, 2018); (2018) Quarterly Insurtech Briefing Q4 2017’, , https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2018/01/quarterly-insurtech-briefing-Q4-2017, (accessed 20th November, 2018); (2018) Global Fintech Report Q2 2018, , https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q2-2018, (accessed 20th November, 2018); Wijngaarde, Y., (2018) A Record €5.5 Billion Invested European Tech in Q2 2018, , https://blog.dealroom.co/a-record-e5-5-billion-invested-european-tech-in-q2-2018-full-report, Based on data from:(accessed 20th November, 2018); Macchi, M., (2018) Address Given at Fintechstage Festival, , Rome, 7th May; (2018), https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-the-conditions-to-be-met-to-benefit-from-an-exemption-from-contingency-measures-under-article-33-6-of-regulation-eu-2018/389-rts-on-sca-csc, Guidelines on the conditions to be met to benefit from an exemption from contingency measures under Article 33(6) of Regulation (EU) 2018/389 (RTS on SCA & CSC), accessed 20th November, 2018; https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/infographic/2018-04/rts-infographic_April%202018.pdf, The principle of strong customer authentication is to ensure customer protection via an increased level of security when conducting electronic payments. The customer’s identity must be verified using at least two of the following items: (1) knowledge — something only the user knows (eg PIN, password); (2) possession — something only the user possesses (eg a card, a mobile phone); and (3) inherence: something the user is (biometric identification like fingerprint, iris or voice recognition etc). For all remote internet and mobile transactions there is an extra element: a unique authentication code which dynamically links the transaction to a specific amount and specific payee. For more information, see: European Payments Council (2018) ‘Understanding the final regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication under PSD2’, accessed 16th November, 2018; The European Commission Maintains Details on Payment Services (PSD2) Transposition Status, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/payment-services-directive-transposition-status_en; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389, The role of the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on Strong Customer Authentication and Common and Secure open standards of Communication is to define specific security measures that were only addressed through general principles in PSD2, and to ensure effective and secure communication between the relevant stakeholders. These measures are directly applicable in EU member states and do not have to be transposed into national law. The RTS has been drafted by the European Banking Authority and has been adopted by the Commission. See: European Commission (2018) ‘Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 of 27 November 2017 supplementing Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication’, accessed 16th November, 2018; Consorzio CBI has around 440 consortium members, representing 95 per cent of the Italian banking sector. For over 20 years, thanks to the governance over a cooperative infrastructure, it has been guaranteeing the implementation of many services which each bank offers competitively to its clients, including the CBI Service which supports multi-bank enterprises in managing corporate treasury and e-invoicing; the Gateway Services for the Central Public Administration, which enable the financial sector to access the public administrations in a centralised way; the CBILL Service for the consultation and the digital payment of bills and of pagoPA payment notifications; and the Big Data CBI Service offered to banks to increase their predictive analysis capabilities through analytical models built on ‘Big Data’ paradigms. Consorzio CBI is undertaking additional projects in the PSD2 field, including the implementation of PSD2 compliant technical specifications APIs and the CBI Globe —Global Open Banking Ecosystem platform, which will allow all members, even across Europe, to simplify the fulfilment of their PSD2 obligations regarding communication with TPPs, while also enhancing the level of protection for consumers; A combination of the words ‘regulatory’ and ‘technology’, a ‘RegTech’ platform (or company)uses new technologies, such as Big Data, cloud-based services, blockchain or artificial intelligence, to support efficient regulatory management via IT.

Services traditionally offered by incumbents are now rapidly unbundled by a growing set of startups, leading to new models of collaboration and a significant shift in power. This study provides insight into the structure of the FinTech ecosystem using data-driven visualizations of 6,493 global companies across 24 market segments. We focus on two types of ecosystem entities, namely, (1) firms that create, offer, and acquire FinTech services and (2) investors that fund and enable them. Our analyses reveal a highly skewed global footprint of FinTech activities, differential growth patterns across ecosystem segments, highly interdependent network structure, and a variegated nature of investments and acquisitions led by key incumbents and venture capital firms. We conclude with theoretical and managerial implications and discuss opportunities for future service ecosystem research. © 2018 INFORMS.","FinTech; Network analysis; Service ecosystem; Transformation; Visualization",,,,,,"(2016) Fintech and the Evolving Landscape: Landing Points for the Industry, , https://www.accenture.com/t20161011T031409Z_w_/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-15/Accenture-Fintech-Evolving-Landscape.pdf, Accenture Accessed June 10, 2018; Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy (2017) J.

A specialized type of accelerator, fintech accelerators are quickly conquering the venture capital market, steadily building up their positions, which is associated with a boom in fintech innovation. In this regard, it may be of interest to gain an insight into some of the key functions fintech accelerators perform in the market and examine some of the key areas of startup support provided by fintech accelerators. The authors have singled out six major functions of fintech accelerators: organizational, financial-economic, consulting, educative, commercial, and evolutionary. In addition, the authors have developed a stage-by-stage procedure for the selection of startups by fintech accelerators for including them in an acceleration program. An analysis of existing terms and conditions regarding accelerator application submission and consideration has helped identify a total of five major stages in the process, as well as put forward a number of ways to enhance the way accelerator applications are processed and considered at the moment. © IAEME Publication.","Accelerator; Fintech; Fintech ecosystem; Innovation; Mentoring; Selection",,,,,,"Shuvalova, E., Sibatulina, N., Kurochkina, I., The tax system and environmental safety (2017) International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM, 17 (54), pp. 401-408; Gryzunova, N.V., Tsertseil, J.S., Kookueva, V.V., Zaharova, D.S., Monetary policy and clustering for achieving competitiveness in national business (2018) European Research Studies Journal, 21 (1), pp. 480-490; Ionova, Y.G., Gesheva, M.V., Handohova, Z.A., Mambetova, K.M., Yu, G.O., Analysis of the functional transformation of industrial complex infrastructure (2017) Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 12 (4 SI), pp. 6790-6798; Kopylov, D.A., Fintekh v mezhdunarodnykh finansakh [Fintech in international finance (2017) Ekonomika I Predprinimatel'Stvo, 12-2, pp. 38-42; Medvedkina, E.A., Finansovye tekhnologii dlya ustoichivogo razvitiya: Metodologiya primeneniya [Financial technology for sustainable development: Application methodology (2017) Finansovye Issledovaniya, 4, pp. 31-36; Pertseva, S., Fintekh: Mekhanizm funktsionirovaniya [Fintech: The mechanism of its operation] (2017) Innovatsii V Menedzhmente, 2, pp. 50-53; (2017) The Rapid Emergence of FinTech, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017/$FILE/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017.pdf, FinTech Adoption Index 2017; Customers in the spotlights: How FinTech is reshaping banking (2016) PricewaterhouseCoopers, , https://www.pwccn.com/en/migration/pdf/global-fintech-survey-jul2016.pdf, 2016; (2016) FinTechs in Europe – Challenger and Partner, , https://www.rolandberger.com/publications/publication_pdf/roland_berger_fintech.pdf, Roland Berger; Value of fintech (2017) KPMG, , https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/value_of_fintech.pdf; (2018) World Fintech, , https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/world-fintech-report-wftr-2018.pdf, report 2018.

Especially, because of rapidly growing online market and supply of mobile devices, the need for mobile Fintech payment service that enables easy online and off-line payment has increased. According to the 2013 report by market research company Gartner, purchase related global mobile payment market size was predicted to grow from $45.1 billion in 2012 to $224.3 billion in 2017 with average annual growth of 38%. The study will surveyed the recent trends of mobile Fintech payment services and categorized them based on the service forms to suggest requirements and security challenges so that better and securer service can be provided in the future. First, the study defined existing payment services and Fintech payment services by comparing them, and analyzed recent mobile Fintech payment services to classify mobile Fintech payment service providers into Hardware makers, Operating System makers, payment platform providers, and financial institutions to show their common features. Finally it defined requirements that mobile Fintech payment services must meet and security challenges that future and present mobile Fintech payment services will encounter in the perspective of mutual authentication, authorization, integrity, privacy, and availability. Through the suggested study, it is expected that mobile Fintech payment services will develop into more secure services in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Finance technology; Fintech; Mobile payment; Security challenges","Authentication; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Average annual growth; Financial institution; Market researches; Mobile payment; Mobile payment market; Mutual authentication; Offline payments; Security challenges; Fintech",,,,,"Lee, A.R., Ahn, H.Y., Fintech users’ information privacy concerns and user resistance: investigating the interaction effect with regulatory focus (2016) J Korea Inst Inf Secur Cryptol, 26 (1), pp. 209-226; Park, S.W., Lee, I.Y., Anonymous authentication scheme based on NTRU for the protection of payment information in NFC mobile environment (2013) J Inf Process Syst, 9, pp. 461-476; Thakur, R., Srivastava, M., Adoption readiness, personal innovativeness, perceived risk and usage intention across customer groups for mobile payment services in India (2014) Internet Res, 24 (3), pp. 369-392; Dahlberg, T., Guo, J., Ondrus, J., A critical review of mobile payment research (2015) Electron Commer Res Appl, 14 (5), pp. 265-284; José Liébana-Cabanillas, F., Sánchez-Fernández, J., Muñoz-Leiva, F., Role of gender on acceptance of mobile payment (2014) Ind Manag Data Syst, 114 (2), pp. 220-240; Perez, A.J., Zeadally, S., Jabeur, N., Security and privacy in ubiquitous sensor networks (2018) J Inf Process Syst, 14, pp. 286-308; Yang, S., Mobile payment services adoption across time: an empirical study of the effects of behavioral beliefs, social influences, and personal traits (2012) Comput Hum Behav, 28 (1), pp. 129-142; Capgemini, R., (2016) World Payments Report 2016, , Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Financial Industry Issues; Gulamhuseinwala, I., Bull, T., Lewis, S., FinTech is gaining traction and young, high-income users are the early adopters (2015) J Financ Perspect, 3 (3), pp. 16-23; Han, Y.H., Lim, H.K., Gil, J.M., Hierarchical location caching scheme for mobile object tracking in the internet of things (2017) J Inf Process Syst, 13, pp. 1410-1429; Steeves, D., The Social Impact of FinTech in Nigeria (2016) The FinTech Book, pp. 78-80. , John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Chichester, UK; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press (2016) Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 2, p. 16; Li, Y., Spigt, R., Swinkels, L., The impact of FinTech start-ups on incumbent retail banks’ share prices (2017) Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 3, p. 26; Lee, S.H., Lee, D.W., (2016) Review on Fintech Industry in Oversea; Skan, J., (2014) The Boom in Global Fintech Investment; Park, Y.J., Jang, S.M., Understanding privacy knowledge and skill in mobile communication (2014) Comput Hum Behav, 38, pp. 296-303; Liang, X., Security and privacy in mobile social networks: challenges and solutions (2014) IEEE Wirel Commun, 21 (1), pp. 33-41; Smalley, S., Craig, R., Security enhanced (SE) android: Bringing flexible MAC to android (2013) Proceedings of the NDSS, 2013, , https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2013/ndss-2013-programme/security-enhanced-se-android-bringing-flexible-mac-android/, In; Li, Q., Clark, G., Mobile security: a look ahead (2013) IEEE Secur Priv, 11 (1), pp. 78-81; Kadhiwal, S., Zulfiquar, A.U.S., Analysis of mobile payment security measures and different standards (2007) Comput Fraud Secur, 2007 (6), pp. 12-16; Linck, K., Pousttchi, K., Wiedemann, D.G., (2006) Security Issues in Mobile Payment from the Customer Viewpoint, pp. 1-11; Zhou, T., An empirical examination of continuance intention of mobile payment services (2013) Decis Support Syst, 54 (2), pp. 1085-1091; Cheong, C.P., Fong, S., Lei, P., Chatwin, C.R., Young, R.C., Designing an efficient and secure credit cardbased payment system with web services based on the ANSI X9.59-2006 (2012) J Inf Process Syst, 8, pp. 495-520; Ondrus, J., Pigneur, Y., An assessment of NFC for future mobile payment systems (2007) International Conference on The.

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all. © 2018 The Authors.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","FHA; Fintech; Lending; Mortgages; Regulatory arbitrage; Shadow banks",,,,,,"Acharya, V., Richardson, M., Van Nieuwerburgh, S., White, L., Guaranteed to Fail: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Debacle of Mortgage Finance (2011), University Press Princeton; Admati, A., DeMarzo, P., Hellwig, M., Pfleiderer, P., The leverage ratchet effect (2018) J.

The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity. Customers are interested in new and more convenient functionality in mobile applications, and they are waiting for new value propositions, including fast international money transfers, roboadvising, personal financial management, peer-to-peer lending. © 2018 IEEE.","digital banking; fintech; fintech business models; fintech infrastructure; fintech landscape","Blockchain; Ecosystems; Finance; Large scale systems; Business models; digital banking; fintech; fintech infrastructure; fintech landscape; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf, Financial Stability Board. 2017.

While banks face sluggish innovation processes, fintechs take advantage of the digital era, delivering customer-centric solutions. Although banks have realized that cooperation with fintechs is a key approach to foster innovation, they struggle to address the associated challenges. Yet, there has been very little research into this phenomenon, so as to establish best practices, because neither bank-fintech cooperation, nor associated and relevant characteristics have been evaluated. However, especially from an economic and financial perspective it is crucial to close this research gap to better understand how technology-driven organizations and cooperating with them reshapes the financial sector and therefore entire economies. Thus, we propose a theoretically founded and empirically proven taxonomy. Based on the literature, 136 real-world cases, and 12 expert interviews, our results suggest structuring and describing bank-fintech cooperation through 13 dimensions. Further, the empirical examination allows for the identification of prevailing cooperation patterns. Our findings contribute to theory development on fintechs, their integration into the banking sector, and the cross-organizational cooperation research area. This paper also has practical implications for both banks and fintechs, and opens promising avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Banking; Cooperation; Digital transformation; Fintechs; Taxonomy",,,,,,"Accenture, The Agile Bank – Transforming the customer experience (2015), https://www.accenture.com/t20150916T712__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/Microsites/Documents19/Accenture-AgileBanking-Infographic.pdf#zoom=50, Retrieved from; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: A longitudinal study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Alt, R., Puschmann, T., The rise of customer-oriented banking – Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry (2012) Electronic Markets, 22 (4), pp. 203-215; Anand, B.N., Khanna, T., Do firms learn to create value?

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain.

In this paper, we use account-level data from LendingClub and Y-14M data reported by U.S. banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could expand credit access to consumers. We find that LendingClub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita. We also find that the portion of LendingClub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Banking competition; Fintech; LendingClub; Marketplace lending; Peer-to-peer lending; Shadow banking",,,,,,"Ahmed, U., Beck, T., McDaniel, C., Schropp, S., Filling the gap: How technology enables access to finance for small- and medium-Sized enterprises (2016) MIT Press Journals: Innovations, 10 (3-4), pp. 35-48; Athwal, N., Online marketplace lending – Recently misunderstood?

However, the current FinTech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of FinTech industry development. To automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a Fin- Tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles. For test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category. For test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services). When we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check. We apply our approach to the CSTP subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion US dollars. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the FinTech system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated test generation; Black-box testing; FinTech","Automation; Data handling; Testing; Automated test generations; Deployed services; Differential testing; FinTech; Foreign exchange; Industry development; Software platforms; Test generations; Black-box testing",,,,,"(2017) Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016, , https://www.accenture.com/t20170411T170619Z-w-/id-en/-acnmedia/PDF-15/Accenture-Fintech-Report-London-Lab-News-Release.pdf; (2018) JaCoCo Java Code Coverage Library, , https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/; Cadar, C., Dunbar, D., Engler, D., KLEE: Unassisted and automatic generation of high-coverage tests for complex systems programs (2008) Proc.

Examining 14 case studies on fintech-bank cooperation, we identified three main reasons: first, banks enable a fintech’s market entry; second, banks increase a fintech’s profits; and finally, banks enable new fintech products. We observed that each of these reasons is related to particular resources, which fintechs obtain through their cooperation partner. Additionally, we found that fintechs use different label approaches to sell their products when they cooperate with banks. Based on these results, we developed propositions that can be tested in future research. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",,,,,,,"Alt, R., Puschmann, T., (2016) Digitalisierung der Finanzindustrie, , Springer, Berlin; Alt, R., Beck, R., Smits, M.T., FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry (2018) Electron.

With the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification. Because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years. The method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk; that is, whether a unit root exists. According to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial; however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures. To deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Kapetanios-Shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis. If the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence. Therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms. The contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology. This is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

It is said that the cause is the Modularization of Technology in Architecture Theory. There is a Japanese industry that is similarly undergoing Modularization, which is the Financial Industry. This paper clarified that FinTech modularizes financial technology. For that purpose, we analyzed the function and structure of FinTech. Also, although it is possible that FinTech could change the existing financial industry structure in Japan, the objective was to propose from the case consideration that the management strategy in that environment is Keystone Strategy. As a conclusion, FinTech was found to be modularized because it has increased its added value after fragmenting financial services technology and breaking it apart. In addition, even if it continues to stay in the integral part, its comprehensive financial services part is inferior to FinTech, so it was expected that it cannot stay in the integral. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

Fintech startups, high-tech firms but also mobile network operators are indeed challenging the status quo with their innovative propositions, trying to disintermediate banks from their traditional function of payment service providers. In the payments market, mobile wallets represent one of the innovations with highest potential of growth in the consumer-to-business segment. Payment market is a large and profitable segment for retail banking. Besides revenue streams from card payment transactions, new sources of revenueas and value creation have been unleashed by digital payments. This paper contributes to provide a better understanding of the mobile wallet ecosystem, also analyzing a set of four business cases so to identify potential sources of competitive advantage for retail banks in a market characterized by an increased non-bank competition.

In this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by RD activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 2018 IEEE.","China; family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)","Engineering; Industrial engineering; China; Family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprise; State owned enterprise; Finance",,,,,"Dorfleitner, G., Hornuf, L., Schmitt, M., Weber, M., FinTech in Germany (2017) Springer International Publishing, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-54666-7; Zhu, X., Understanding China's growth: Past, present and future (2012) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26 (4), pp. 103-124; Boycko, M., Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., A theory of privatization (1996) Economic Journal, 106 (435), pp. 309-319; Megginson, W., Netter, J., From state to market: A survey of empirical studies on privatization (2001) Journal of Economics Literature, 39 (2), pp. 321-389; Kornai, J., Resource-constrained versus demand-constrained systems (1979) Econometrica, 47 (4), pp. 801-819; Kornai, J., (1980) Economics of Shortage, , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Allen, F., Qian, J., Qian, M., Law, finance, and economic growth in China (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (1), pp. 57-116; Jensen, M.C., Meckling, W.H., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (4), pp. 305-360; Megginson, W., Ullah, B., Wei, Z., State ownership, soft-budget constraints, and cash holdings: Evidence from China's privatized firms (2014) Journal of Banking & Finance, 48, pp. 276-291; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Maksimovic, V., Financing patterns around the world: Are small firms different?

The rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle. Technology simplifies and accelerates human being in doing its activity. The development of digital technology (disruptive technology) has an impact on all aspects of human life. The purpose of this research is to see the phenomenon of the conventional banking in Indonesia to make changes in its business processes in order to compete with Fintechs Company that is growing rapidly. This research method looks at the phenomenon on conventional banking in Indonesia by looking at the impact of technology and digital. The first phenomenon is the rapid development in the world currently occur in the digital economy, one of which is a digital-based financial service known as financial technology (FinTech). The second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of Indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles). The third phenomenon is FinTechs services in Indonesia include Payment channel system, Digital Banking, Online/Digital Insurance, Peer-to-peer (P2P) Lending and Crow funding. Banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes. There is a gap that has not been served by banks in Indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by Start-up Company (pioneer) FinTech in providing services and banking products. Banking in Indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) FinTech by changing its business process by doing Business Process Reengineering (BPR). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Finance; Peer to peer networks; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Financial service; Potential benefits; Public transportation; research methods; Start-up companies; Electronic publishing",,,,,"Siregar, A.E., (2016) Financial Technology Trend Bisnis Keuangan Ke Depan, , (infobanknews.com); Hadad, M., (2017) Financial Technology (FinTech) di Indonesia Kuliah Umum Tentang Fintech-IBS; Ramanigopal, C.S., Palaniappan, G., Hemalatha, N., Murugan, T., Business Process Reengineering and Its Applications (2011) International Journal of Management Research and Review, 1, pp. 275-288; Ringim, K.J., Osman, N.H., Hasnan, N., Razalli, M.R., Exploring the Implementation of Business Process Reengineering in Banks (2013) Asian Social Science, 9; Osano, M.H., Okwena, D., Factors Influencing Performance of Business of Business Process Reengineering Projects in Bank in Kenya : Case of Kenya Comemercial Bank (2015) Journal of US-China Public AdMinistration, 12, pp. 26-34; Moad, J., Does reengineering really work (1993) Datamation, , August 1; Barrett, J.L., Process visualization: Getting the vision right is the key (1994) Information Systems Management, 11 (2), pp. 14-23; Guha, S., Kettinger, W., Teng, T., Business process reengineering: Building a comprehensive methodology (1993) Information Systems Management, Summer, 12, pp. 3-22; Jackson, N., Business process re-engineering (1997) Management Services, 12, pp. 34-36; Al-Mashari, M., Zairi, M., BPR implementation process: An analysis of key success and failure factors (1999) Business Process Management Journal, 5 (1), pp. 87-112; Ika, A., (2017) Bisnis Model Baru Bank-Fintech Dan Ekonomi Digital, , www.kompas.com; (2017) Redwaring the Lines: Fintech's Growing Influence on Financial Services PWC, , Global FinTech Report",,"Abdullah A.G.Nandiyanto A.B.D.Warlina L.Kurniati P.S.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Informatics, Engineering, Science and Technology, INCITEST 2018","9 May 2018 through 10 May 2018",,140092,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Taking advantage of digital means of communication, most of the service interactions between fintechs and customers occurs via chats or posts in social media. In this work, our goal is to use machine learning to analyze these posts and identify what are the terms used by customers to express positive, neutral and negative customer experiences. During this analysis, we assess the following questions using data from the 3 biggest fintechs in Brazil: (i) what are the most commented topics on social media regarding fintechs, (ii) what are the words more often used by customers to express positive, negative and neutral reactions to the customer service obtained; and (iii) what kind of machine learning model should a fintech use to automatically identify whether a post is positive, negative or neutral. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Sales; Social networking (online); Customer services; Digital solutions; Machine learning models; Money transfers; Negative customers; Service interaction; Social media; Technology companies; Learning systems",,,,,"Liarte, E.B., (2016) Radiografía Del Fintech-clasificación, Recopilación y Análisis de Las Principales Startups, , Master's thesis, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya; Trelewicz, J.Q., Big data and big money: The role of data in the financial sector (2017) IT Professional, 19 (3), pp. 8-10; Kaur, H., Mangat, V., Nidhi, A survey of sentiment analysis techniques (2017) 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 921-925. , Feb; Bruno, G., Text mining and sentiment extraction in central bank documents (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 1700-1708. , Dec; Patil, P.S., Dharwadkar, N.V., Analysis of banking data using machine learning (2017) 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 876-881. , Feb; Bravo-Marquez, F., Frank, E., Pfahringer, B., Building a twitter opinion lexicon from automatically-annotated tweets (2016) Know.-Based Syst., 108 (C), pp. 65-78. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.05.018, Sep; Franzoni, V., Li, Y., Mengoni, P., A path-based model for emotion abstraction on facebook using sentiment analysis and taxonomy knowledge (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, Ser.

This growth indicates that people behaviour change in many aspects of life including in economy. One example is (Fintech P2P Lending). P2P lending is a service that offers online borrowing, lenders can loan to small business or individuals. This is in line with the Indonesia Financial Services Sector Master Plan 2015-2019. Indonesia support the rapid growth of the financial technology ecosystem, but there is need good understanding between related parties such as P2P Lending companies, lenders and borrowers. A system dynamics act as calculators to takes value to fill payoff table in game theory. Integration of system dynamics and game theory can produce the best strategy for Fintech P2P Lending in running its business while considering profit for lenders and borrowers. The best strategy is known by use non-cooperative and cooperative game theory.

The Fintech industry's development model is continuously developing and innovating, and it constantly impacts and transforms the traditional financial industry. Fintech has become the country's policy direction and economic development trend, leading to an increase in Fintech's talent demand, and the development of Fintech's talent has become critical. This paper describes the situation of Fintech industry from three aspects: the development of Fintech industry at home and abroad, the demand of Fintech talents and the training status of Fintech talents. This paper also suggests that colleges and universities should seize the opportunity to explore new teaching modes such as school-enterprise cooperation for Fintech and providing good talents protection for the development of Fintech. © 2018 IEEE.","Fintech; Fintech industry; Fintech talents; Talent training","Education computing; Finance; Colleges and universities; Economic development; Fintech; Fintech talents; Industry development; School-enterprise cooperations; Talent trainings; Technological communities; Engineering education",,,,,"Lee, I., Fintech: Ecosystem and business models [C] (2016) U-and E-Service, Science and Technology, pp. 57-62; Shim, Y., Shin, D.H., Analyzing China's fintech industry from the perspective of actor-network theory [J] (2016) Telecommunications Policy, 40 (2-3), pp. 168-181; Kotarba, M., New factors inducing changes in the retail banking customer relationship management (CRM) and their exploration by the FinTech industry [J] (2016) Foundations of Management, 8 (1), pp. 69-78; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., The FinTech phenomenon: Antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press [J] (2016) Financial Innovation, 2 (1), p. 16; Wonglimpiyarat, J., FinTech banking industry: A systemic approach [J] (2017) Foresight",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","13th International Conference on Computer Science and Education, ICCSE 2018","8 August 2018 through 11 August 2018",,139984,,9781538654958,,,"English","Int.

Fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially. It could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces. Yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the European Union (EU). Even the largest fintech market, in China, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation. In the EU, much of fintech is concentrated in the UK. We argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently. (i) Develop a European or national fintech market? (ii) What regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) Should supervision of fintech be exercised at the European level? (iv) What is the overall vision for the EU's financial system? Getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. In contrast, late action could mean that Europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in Europe. © The Author(s) 2018.

The states have historically overseen and regulated nonbank companies, including nonbank financial services providers like money transmitters, mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, and debt collectors. Applicable regulations include state safety and soundness requirements and both state and federal consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the OCC announced its intention to create a new national bank charter for nonbank companies, thus pulling chartered nonbank fintech companies into the national bank regulatory system. This will potentially preempt and replace the licensing, regulation, and supervision responsibilities of state authorities while allowing circumvention of other regulatory safeguards. Moreover, this power grab by the OCC is beyond its authority as delegated by Congress. In addition to questions of the legality of the charters and whether state or federal regulators are better situated to regulate such institutions, the proposed charters raise significant concerns regarding the separation of commerce and banking that has been a hallmark of the U.S. financial regulatory system since the founding of the country. © 2018 George Washington University.

What is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? Research Findings/Insights: We document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (VC) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis. We show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis. Also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts. These fintech VC deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation. For entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs. We argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts. Less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. National governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Corporate Governance; Financial Regulation; Fintech; International Venture Capital; Regulatory Arbitrage",,,,,,"(2015) The future of FinTech and banking: Digitally disrupted or reimagined?

The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world. In this paper, we present a proactive FinTech model that uses the IoT intelligence to deliver positive InsurTech feedback. We propose an InsurTech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server. The driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions. The feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards. Given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations. We have used real user data collected by the MapBar Auto Guard devices deployed in China to show an example of how IoT supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm. We believe our proactive FinTech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.","Feedback; Fintech; InsurTech; UBI","Customer satisfaction; Internet of things; Cost minimization; Economic modeling; Fintech; InsurTech; Internet of thing (IOT); Potential benefits; Potential rewards; Technological advancement; Feedback",,,,,"Lee, I., Shin, Y.J., Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges (2018) Business Horizons, 61 (1), pp. 35-46; Zavolokina, S.G.L., Dolata, M., Fintech whats in a name?

Departing from an assessment of the already problematic and jeopardised uses of traditional credit data in the Member States, it concludes that the risks are likely to contrast or outweigh the benefits, but the legal framework does not seem fit for purpose despite the enactment of brand new legislation. © The Author(s) 2018.","big data; consumers; credit; EU law; FinTech",,,,,,,"Ferretti, F.; Associate Professor in Economic Law and Financial Markets, University of BolognaItaly; email: fed.ferretti@libero.it",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,1023263X,,,,"English","Maastricht J.

Leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, FinTech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance. Despite increasing investments, the FinTech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights. So far, the offerings of FinTech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective. As a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of FinTech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics. Thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented FinTech start-ups. Our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 FinTech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis.

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed in the past 3 years. Fin-tech is facing a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts new way of living in modern digital technology era. Basically, Fin-tech is offering three main categories such as payment, personal finance and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding and also loan marketplace. All of this kind application has some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the using of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects etc. The using of big data and those new technologies have created new opportunities for these sectors, these developments also raise significant data protection concerns. This paper will discuss two legal issues of Fin-tech, the legal aspect and the data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Consumer; Data Protection; Financial Technology","Big data; Commerce; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Facings; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Peer to peer networks; Planning; Social sciences computing; Sustainable development; Communication technologies; Connected objects; Consumer; Digital technologies; Financial institution; Financial service; New technologies; Technology service; Consumer protection",,,,,"Schueffel, P., Taming the Beast: A Scientific Definition of Fintech (2016) Journal of Innovation Management, p. 45; Desai, F., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/falgunidesai/2015/12/13/the-evolution-of-fintech/#71e09ed17175, December 13; Arner, D., Barberis, J., Buckley, R., (2016) The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, , (New Sout Wales: University of New South Wales); Apjii, (2016) Infografis Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , (Jakarta: APJII); (2016) Indonesian Fintech Report, , (Jakarta: DailySocial.id); Erik Vermeulen, M.F., (2016) Regulation Tomorrow: What Happens When Technology Is Faster Than the Law?, , October (The Netherlands: Tilburg); Adiwaluyo, I.E., Teknologi Aman, Bisnis Model Ditata (2017) Marketeers, p. 45. , April; Alistair Milne, P.P., (2016) The Business Models and Economics of Peer-to-Peer Lending, , May (United Kingdom: Lougborough); Edy, (2016) Fintech World and New Styles in Payment, , December 06 Jakarta, Indonesia; Mykhaylo, (2017) Applications of Blockchain Technology in Fintech, , https://www.romexsoft.com/blog/blockchain-technology-in-fintech/, January January; (2016) An International Perspective Report on IOSCO'S Cyber Risk Coordination Efforts, , Cyber Security in Securities Markets Commissions",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017",,138331,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Various types of technology based innovative financial business models or financial technology (fin-tech) are growing rapidly around the world, including Indonesia. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) incorporates the fin-tech progress in its work plan in 2017 in the perspective of financial stability. In Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority has issued the Financial Services Authority Regulation No: 77/FSAR.01/2016 on Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services to provide a legal basis for fin-tech activities, in particular services with peer to peer lending models. In practice, fin-tech in Indonesia is not only used to facilitate lending and borrowing, but also used for other business models, especially start-up business, investment and social activities, which are not included in the scope of lending and borrowing. On the other hand, fin-tech development in Indonesia is expected to contribute to economic development, particularly in facilitating micro, small and medium enterprises to gain access to finance. The advantages of fin-tech include cost efficiency and ease of access to finance, but on the other hand there are some obstacles and risks that potentially arise, such as credit risk, insufficient technology, misuse of funds and user/consumer data and protection of national interests such as money laundering as well as disruption to monetary stability. Therefore, in addition to the need for comprehensive regulation, supervisory aspects by the financial services authorities are urgently needed to make fin-tech a part of the financial services sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fin-tech- legal challenges- financial industry","Economics; Fins (heat exchange); Investments; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Authority regulations; Economic development; Financial industry; Financial services sector; Financial stability; Peer-to-peer lending; Small and medium enterprise; Technology advances; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Buckley, R.P., Webster, S., Fin-Tech in Developing Countries: Charting New Customer Journeys (2016) J Capco Inst J Financ Transform, 11, pp. 151-189; Lee Kuo, C., Emergence of fintech and the LASIC Principles (2015) J Financ Perspect, pp. 03-26; Director of Supervision and Fin-tech Licensing: Only 7 Fintech Companies Listed in FSA, , http://keuangan.kontan.co.id/news/baru-tujuh-perusahaan-fintech-terdaftar-di-ojk, Financial Services Authority; (2017) There Are 600 Fintech in Indonesia, only 157 Are Reported to FSA, , https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20170214134913-78-193433/ada-600-fintech-di-indonesia-baru-157-yang-lapor-ke-ojk/, Deputy Commissioner of NBFI II; (2016) Fintech Innovation: An Overview, , Clement Ancri (Board of the Federal Reserve System) (Washington DC); (2016) Message from Bank Indonesia Governor-Launching Bank Indonesia Fintech Office, , http://www.bi.go.id/id/ruang-media/pidato-dewan-gubernur/Documents/Sambutan-GBI-Launching-Fintech-0ffice-14Nov2016.pdf, Bank Indonesia",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017",,138331,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Papazoglou, M.P., Georgakopoulos, D., Service oriented computing: Introduction (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 25-28; Meredith, L.G., Bjorg, S., Contracts and types (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 41-47; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, p. 2; Josuttis Nicloai, M., SOA in practice (2007) O'Relly 2007, p. 210; Richard, B., (2005) Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, , Department of Computer Information Systems, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University; Bret, K., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, , Business; Riad, A.M., Hassan, Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications (2008) JCIT, 3 (1). , March 31, 2008; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions (2003) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03); Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Fajar, A.N., Nurcahyo, A., Sriratnasari, S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia (2018) Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management, , https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-budget-apps-for-moneymanagement-586807/, Android Authority, 16-Jul-2018.

There are two types of fintech, i.e. card-based electronic wallet and application-based digital cash. The aim of this research is to rank the acceptance factors of e-wallet and digital cash by low income individuals. Initially, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to develop a structural hierarchy of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was followed by interviews with fintech experts to validate the structural hierarchy. Finally, AHP pairwise comparison questionnaires were filled out by 18 respondents, who have experiences using electronic wallet or digital cash. The results show that highest reception factor of both fintech types is ease of use. Speed is the second top rank acceptance factor of electronic wallet, whilst cost-benefit is the second factor of digital cash reception. These findings can enable fintech providers to improve their better marketing strategy, by enhancing their products related its ease of use, speed, and cost. © 2018 IEEE.","Acceptance factor; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Digital cash; Electronic transaction; Electronic wallet; Financial technology (fintech); Payment system; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Analytic hierarchy process; Cost benefit analysis; Finance; Hierarchical systems; Marketing; Surveys; Wages; Acceptance factor; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Electronic transaction; Electronic wallet; Financial technology (fintech); Payment systems; Systematic literature review (SLR); Electronic money",,,,,"Arango, C.A., Hogg, D., Lee, A., Why is cash (still) so entrenched?

This exploration is based on findings from previous studies that suggest that trust and risk are important aspects in considering the use of FinTech. The focus of this research is to develop and validate the research instruments that will be used next. The basic theory of model development uses the theory of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis. The models and instruments developed will be through pilot studies involving 133 communities as respondents. This Study is quantitative research and data obtained were analyzed using smart pls v3.0. This analysis is conducted to ensure the level of reliability and validity of the instrument. The results of this analysis find 31 instruments that are stated reliable and validity. So it can be used for collecting data from a survey in accordance with the research. © 2018 IEEE.","FinTech; Perceived Risk; TAM; Trust","Engineering; FinTech; Model development; Perceived risk; Quantitative research; Reliability and validity; Research instruments; Technology acceptance model; Trust; Reliability analysis",,,,,"Nicoletti, B., (2017) The Future of FinTech.; Moon, W.Y., Kim, S.D., A payment mediation platform for heterogeneous fintech schemes (2017) Proc. 2016 IEEE Adv.

Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples. © 2018","Business model; FinTech; Innovation; IoT; Mobility","Carrier mobility; Business modeling; Business models; Business sector; Company development; FinTech; New business models; New services; Products and services; Internet of things",,,,,"Nakashima, T., Lets Build the True Eco-Car (2010), Tokyo Nikkei BP; Mandaluyong City.

Hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe. Strikingly, many of these efforts have failed. This study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era. I compare three mobile payment projects – Oi Paggo in Brazil, TCASH in Indonesia, and M-PESA in Kenya – as case studies. I argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures. Three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (MNOs) – telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case study methods; Developing countries; Financial services; Financial transactions; Fintech; Innovation; Mobile payment; Modularity; Networks; Payment networks; Platforms; Technology ecosystems","Developing countries; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Networks (circuits); Supply chains; Case study methods; Financial service; Financial transactions; Fintech; Mobile payment; Modularity; Platforms; Technology ecosystem; Electronic money",,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Bockstedt, J., Gupta, A., Kauffman, R.J., Making sense of technology trends in the information technology landscape (2008) MIS Q., 32 (4), pp. 779-809; Adomavicius, G., Bockstedt, J., Gupta, A., Kauffman, R.J., Understanding evolution in technology ecosystems (2008) Commun.

However, many of the financial entities that provide such amounts do not have granting models that adapt to the specific characteristics of that market. Therefore, the development of granting models that are based on new institutional policies, which integrate quantitative and qualitative information designed exclusively to serve this sector of the population, is relevant. This article presents a methodology for the re-rate of credits from a database corresponding to a financial institution that is dedicated to the placement of resources effectively. For this re-rate a Vector Support Machine with Logistic Kernel was used, which given its flexibility and high classification capacity, allowed generating three granting models, where its results showed the partial relationships that define the granting policies of a given financial entity. © 2018 AISTI.","Consumer Credit; Neural Model; Re-rating Credits; Support Vector Machine","Finance; Information systems; Information use; Support vector machines; Consumer credits; Financial institution; Institutional policies; Neural modeling; Neural network model; Qualitative information; Vectors",,,,,"De Colombia, S.F., De, S.F., (2017) Actualidad Del Sistema Financiero Colombiano; Bekhet, H.A., Eletter, S.F.K., Credit risk assessment model for Jordanian commercial banks: Neural scoring approach (2014) Review of Development Finance, 4 (1), pp. 20-28. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rdf.2014.03.002; Duo, M., Kun, Q., Credit risk management of commercial bank (2014) Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research, 2014, pp. 1784-1788; Lin, Y., Zhang, Y., Credit risk assessment based on neural network (2012) 8th International Conference on Natural Computation, (Icnc), pp. 402-404; Silva, C., Vasconcelos, G., Frana, G., (2015) Case-based Reasoning Combined with Neural Networks for Credit Risk Analysis; Zhao, Investigation and improvement of multilayer perceptron neural networks for credit scoring (2015) Expert Systems with Applications; Liu, T., Zhang, Q., A new credit risk assessment approach based on artificial neural network (2014) Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research, 2014, pp. 157-163; West, D., Neural network credit scoring models (2000) Computers &Operations Research, 27, pp. 1131-1152. , 2000; Harris, T., Credit scoring using the clustered support vector machine (2015) Expert Systems with Applications; Ghatge, M.A.R., Halkarnikar, P.P., Estimation of credit risk for business firms of nationalized bank by neural network approach (2012) IJECSE, 2 (3), pp. 828-834; Nurlybayeva, K., Algorithmic scoring models (2013) Appl.

Financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies. Alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents. In large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank. Meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service. Financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life. This means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand. With practical steps businesses and, in particular, financial services organisations need to take to participate in a global service ecosystem, this book will be of interest to financial professionals who work in banking, financial technology, and development finance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

However, the era of lightweight innovation and limited advancements in payments technology is coming to an end. The revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) gives third parties the opportunity to develop, launch and become the preferred payments channel in regions where no alternative exists. Increasing smartphone adoption and internet access will see mobile become the dominant channel for everyday purchases. As payments are commoditised, the value of this channel is no longer limited to transaction fees. Instead, it is derived from user volume and data.Tech giants, such as Facebook, Google and Apple, recognise that data equal power and have made evidential steps toward becoming payment powerhouses. Banks bring formidable strengths to the payments arena. There are considerable benefits and revenue sources available to those that mobilise their long-term payment channels. Partnering with FinTechs allows banks to quickly become agile and launch cost-efficient minimum viable products and to test new ideas.

Nowadays, the financial services are accessed by almost anyone, anywhere, anytime via smartphones or tablets. This article aims to investigate the effects of technology, personal and environment on intention towards the intention to use mobile payment system in Vietnam, based on a technology acceptance model (TAM) and Technology, Personal and Environment (TPE) framework. The proposed model consists three technical factors, three personal factors, and one environmental factor. Users’ perceived ease of use is the strongest influenced by mobile payment knowledge, whereas personal innovativeness is the most influential factor to the usefulness of mobile payment. Interestingly, the results indicate that perceived cost and compatibility have insignificant effects over the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the relationships between the variables are influenced by gender and occupation. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2018.","Fintech; Intention to use; Mobile payment system; TAM; TPE framework; Vietnam",,,,,,"Adams, D.A., Nelson, R.R., Todd, P.A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication (1992) MIS Quarterly, 16, pp. 227-247; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA; Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, pp. 141-164; Burnham, T.A., Frels, J.K., Mahajan, V., Consumer switching costs: A typology, antecedents and consequences (2003) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31 (2), pp. 109-126; Chang, M., Cheung, W., Lai, V., Literature derived reference models for the adoption of online shopping (2005) Information & Management, 42 (4), pp. 543-559; Chau, P.Y., Tam, K.Y., Factors affecting the adoption of open systems: An exploratory study (1997) MIS Quarterly, pp. 1-24; Cheng, T.C.E., Lam, D.Y.C., Yeung, C.L., Adoption of internet banking: An empirical study in Hong Kong (2006) Decision Support Systems, 42, pp. 1558-1572; Dahlberg, T., Mallat, N., Öörni, A., (2003) Trust Enhanced Technology Acceptance Modelconsumer Acceptance of Mobile Payment Solutions, pp. 22-23. , Paper presented at The 2nd Mobility Roundtable, Stockholm, Sweden; Dahlberg, T., Mallat, N., Ondrus, J., Zmijewska, A., Past, present and future of mobile payments research: A literature review (2008) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, pp. 165-181; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Featherman, M.S., Pavlou, P.A., Predicting e-services adoption: A perceived risk facets perspective (2003) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 59 (4), pp. 451-474; Gastal, F., year?

But the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided. Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself. These changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance. In particular, this Article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants. The Article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards. © 2017 Vanderbilt Law Review.

To accompany the development and advancement of new means of access and service, the banks have sought the adoption of friendly and efficient digital platforms so that they can contain the advances of fintechs. Given this situation, the study aims to identify how fintechs are characterized as opportunities and threats for large financial institutions in Brazil. In order to understand and analyze the aspects related to fintechs, the research approaches topics that are aligned to the theme, such as the current context of the economy, the National Financial System and the scenario of start-ups in Brazil. This study has a descriptive and qualitative character, in which the data were collected from interviews with those responsible for financial institutions. The research allowed to identify that there is the acceptance by the great institutions to apply this fintechs model. It was also observed that there is a need to regulate the sector so that it can grow with more freedom and thus be able to add to the country this technological wealth, but it analyzes the need to be less bureaucratic like the financial institutions that operate in the market. The study presented the limitations of a few cases, in which it was not possible to interview more management in others companies which are involved in some way with the innovations of the organization. From this situation, it is suggested that other studies are carried out in order to cover other interesting points that concern the fintechs business model. The study allowed us to understand how large companies already established in the financial market identify fintechs and their business models. Identifying opportunities, threats and how this understanding permits the fintechs to prepare for a competitive market, and for large companies to understand how this model can be characterized as an ally. In relation to the originality, several studies have been developed in the scope of financial market. However, when researching in scientific databases, little is explored about fintechs and the perception of its business model by other players in the sector. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

These efforts have given rise to numerous approaches, including, most notably, fintech-bank partnerships structured to avoid state licensing regimes. While another obvious option is a bank charter, few fintech firms have seriously considered bank charters due to a number of cost, compliance and other factors that make becoming a bank too burdensome. Recent developments, however, suggest that the bank charter option may be worthy of reconsideration. This article explores the opportunities, costs, risks and other factors that fintech firms should weigh in considering a bank charter and various charter options currently available or in development in the United States. Notably, the scope of this article does not include non-U.S. charter and similar options, of which there are a number of alternatives, including in the UK, Singapore and other jurisdictions. © 2018 Banking Law Journal.

Despite access to fast-paced technology known as FinTech, an antiquated business model and internal organizational paralysis do not allow for the creation of a truly beloved brand and are stifling change. To survive and thrive when their competition is catching up, banks must understand the principles behind Emotional Banking-a cultural change concept that brings the consumer to the center of rethinking banking products and delivery. This book starts with a history of the space then moves into an overview of what FinTech is. After discussing the state of banking today including stories from the biggest names in the industry, the concept of Emotional Banking and Brand are introduced as an answer to the problems outlined above. It concludes with examples of best practices and a hands-on approach on how to change the inertia, become a brand and make customers fall in love with their bank. Some of the questions this book tackles include: · Why don't banks ""care""? · How many banks will survive? · What is FinTech and why does it matter? · Can Banks become beloved brands and find their way to the consumer's heart? · Why is there a disconnect between what we say and what we do in the industry? · Is inertia in banking a result of broken internal culture? · Which big brand or challenger will be at the top in 5 years? © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Re-visiting past and present discourses can be illuminating in at least three ways: it can reveal the broader picture of the present financialized and technologized world and the rise of financial technologies; it can provide scholars with new vocabularies, concepts, and metaphors to comprehend present-day phenomena and developments; and it can reveal the variety of commitments that are possible, today, too. This article starts with a discussion of the original ‘crisis of modernity’ discourses (avant la lettre), in which the clashing arguments of Comte and Tocqueville are featured, and a discussion of a second ‘crisis of modernity’ that developed in the context of the ‘Great Depression.’ A third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse emerged in the wake of the financial crises of the 1970s. Such crises are still ongoing and discussed within the boundaries of the third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse. How financial technologies do and do not fit within this third discourse is discussed in the remainder of this article. © 2017, The Author(s).","Crisis; Democracy; Financial technologies; Financialization; Ideology; Mechanization modernity discourses",,,,,,"Abolafia, M.Y., Can speculative bubbles be managed?

Nonetheless, in recent years, FinTechs - un-regulated start-ups applying technology to finance - have exponentially accelerated such race, making innovative regulatory approaches and new perspectives necessary. The present paper discusses relevant issues pertaining to the regulation of FinTech, using financial-return crowdfunding (FR-crowdfunding) as case study and model, deriving from its FinTech, shadow banking and collaborative economy natures, important indications for regulators. Current trends in regulating FR-crowdfunding in Member States are also analysed, together with related shortcomings and benefits, with the view to proposing a more harmonised regime for the sector, tailored to its risks and features and advancing Capital Markets Union objectives. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",,,,,,,"Kane, E., Impact of regulation on economic behavior.

Entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse. Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified. Collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations and technologies that Q2 are transforming the financial services industry worldwide.

The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the “Fintech Revolution” is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

Examples include internet banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, robo-advice and virtual currencies. These applications show that the digital revolution is irreversibly changing the way people live, including the way they interact with the financial system. The rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level. Thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the European Union dealing with FinTech? Due to the broad scope of FinTech, EU regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation. On the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance. A possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model. © 2018 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus.

It includes design, delivery, and provider of financial investment services such as payments, real estate, investment, insurance/ takaful, deposits, financing, banking, saving and capital market. This study is about Adoption of Financial Technology (FinTech) in mutual fund/ unit trust investment among Malaysians: Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The study aims to identify the level of financial technology consumption in mutual fund/ unit trust among investors in Malaysia. The objectives of this research are: 1) to determine the level of awareness on FinTech application in mutual fund/ unit trust investment; 2) to examine the adoption of FinTech in mutual fund/ unit trust investment. The objectives will explore on how FinTech changes the customers in terms of to what extent Malaysians have adopted FinTech so far. The research methodology in an adoption of FinTech service in mutual fund/ unit trust was conducted through questionnaires survey. This study assists participants in financial service management to take advantage of the opportunities offered by FinTech services. Developing the effective and systematic framework is a must for FinTech service especially in mutual fund/ unit trust investment.

And yet, there remains a dearth of research on how these ecosystems may be developed, as well as the economic and social benefits that they can generate. Toward addressing this gap, this research-in-progress paper documents our ongoing work on a case study of the Fintech Ecosystem in Indonesia that is radically transforming the lives of the underbanked in the country. We will present a preliminary process model based on the data we have currently collected to reveal the key drivers, inhibitors, nature and outcomes of ecosystem development across three distinct phases. In doing so, we hope that our study will serve as a foundation for developing a holistic and empirically supported theoretical framework for Fintech Ecosystem Development, and provide academia and practice with insights into unlocking the revolutionary potential of the technology.","Case Study; Ecosystem Development; Fintech; Indonesia; Startup","Ecology; Reactor startup; Economic and social benefits; Ecosystem development; Financial service; Fintech; Indonesia; Paper documents; Process Modeling; Theoretical framework; Ecosystems",,,,,"Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Annie, T., Fintech is struggling in Indonesia, but startups are doing something about it (2016) Techinasia, , https://www.techinasia.com/fintech-indonesia-event; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of FinTech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, , http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/221450; Arsana, I.G.P., Alibhai, A.S., (2016) Women Entrepreneurs in Indonesia: A Pathway to Increasing Shared Prosperity, , http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/738881467782741648/Women-entrepreneurs-in-Indonesia-a-pathway-to-increasing-shared-prosperity; Bakker, E., (2016) Here'S Everything You Need to Know About The Fintech Ecosystem, , http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fintech-ecosystem-overview-2016-1; Bakos, Y., Katsamakas, E., Design and ownership of two-sided networks: Implications for internet platforms (2008) Journal of Management Information Systems, 25 (2), pp. 171-202; Biernacki, P., Waldorf, D., Snowball sampling: Problems and techniques of chain referral sampling (1981) Sociological Methods & Research, 10 (2), pp. 141-163; Chan, R., Asian regulators seek fintech balance (2015) FinanceAsia, , http://www.financeasia.com/News/401588,asian-regulators-seek-fintech-balance.aspx; Charleston, L.-J., Why Fintech Is The Most Important Industry Right Now (2015) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/10/01/fintech-our-most-importantindustry_n_8219360.html; Cusumano, M.A., Gawer, A., The elements of platform leadership (2002) MIT Sloan Management Review, 43 (3), p. 51; Dapp, T.F., (2015) Fintech Reloaded – Traditional Banks as Digital Ecosystems, , https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_DEPROD/PROD0000000000356835/Fintech+reloaded+%E2%80%93+Traditional+banks+as+digital+ec.PDF; Diemers, D., Lamaa, A., Salamat, J., Steffens, T., Developing a FinTech ecosystem in the GCC (2015) Strategy&, , http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/reports/developing-fintech-ecosystemgcc; Dietz, M., Khanna, S., Olanrewaju, T., Rajgopal, K., (2015) Cutting Through The Noise Around Financial Technology, , http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/ourinsights/cutting-through-the-noise-around-financial-technology; Dinardo, F., (2016) The Rise of Alternative Finance, , http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/53120/1/Dinardo_Francesca.pdf; Doz, Y.L., Kosonen, M., Embedding strategic agility: A leadership agenda for accelerating business model renewal (2010) Long Range Planning, 43 (2), pp. 370-382; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building Theories from Case Study Research (1989) The Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Eisenmann, T., Parker, G., Van Alstyne, M.W., Strategies for two-sided markets (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (10), pp. 92-101; Eisenmann, T., Parker, G., Van Alstyne, M.W., Platform envelopment (2011) Strategic Management Journal, 32 (12), pp. 1270-1285; Finkle, V., (2017) Issue: Fintech Fintech, , http://businessresearcher.sagepub.com; Glaser, B., Strauss, A., (1967) The Discovery Ofgrounded Theory, 24 (25), pp. 288-304. , London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson; The Future of Finance (2015) Goldman Sachs, , http://www.planet-fintech.com/file/167061/; Hochstein, M., BankThink Fintech (the Word, That Is) Evolves (2015) American Banker, , https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/fintech-the-word-that-is-evolves; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., (2004) Keystones and Dominators: Framing Operating and Technology Strategy in A Business Ecosystem; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78; Jones, C.O., Fintech – Where financial services and tech combine (2015) Strategies for Growth, , http://www.strategiesforgrowth.com/innovate/fintech-where-financial-services-andtech-combine/; Keane, J., IDG Connect (2015) Indonesia Is Priming Itself for A Fintech Future, , http://www.idgconnect.com/abstract/10696/indonesia-priming-fintech-future; Kelly, E., (2015) Introduction: Business Ecosystems Come of Age, , https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/business-trends/2015/business-ecosystems-come-ofage-business-trends.html, Deloitte University Press (; Kobie, N., Fintech firms are taking on the 1%, but can they fix finance?

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Thai investors is willing to accept algorithm trading as a new financial technology, but still has concern about the reliability and profitable of this new stock trading strategy. Therefore, algorithm trading can be promoted by building inves-tors’ trust on algorithm trading as a reliable and profitable trading strategy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Promotion of the digital economy in the financial sector is a high-priority task for the short-term perspective. Nicholas Negroponte, an American scientist, first used the concept of “digital economy” in 1995. Since then, this concept has started spreading rapidly with the help of the Internet and has enhanced exchange and storage of information, complex calculations, and computer modeling of engineering facilities. In the new economy, digital platforms are the most open electronic platforms that allow receiving full information about financial institutions and organizations; they are also being developed primarily for the financial sector. The introduction of digital technologies can lead to the reduction of headcount of financial institutions. Digitalization and online publishing of documents related to various tenders and purchases may contribute to the reduction of risks and corruption. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Banking framework; Blockchain; Competency-based approach; Digital economy; Digitalization; Information and financial technologies",,,,,,"Albekov, U.A., Vovchenko, N., Andreeva, G., Vladimirovna, O., Sichev, R.A., Block chain and financial controlling in the system of technological provision of large corporations (2017) European Research Studies Journal, 20 (3B), pp. 3-12; Andreeva, A.V., Marketing management of digitalization processes in the financial sector (2016) Journal of Science and Education: Economy and Financial Economy; Entrepreneurship; Law and Management, 8 (75), p. 28; Andreeva, L.Y., Dzhemaev, O.T., The impact of the digital economy on the formation of new trends in the Russian labor market, State and Municipal Management (2017) Scientific Notes of RANEPA, 3, pp. 25-32; Andreeva, O.V., Financial mechanism for sustainable development of industrial corporations (2015) Journal of Science and Education: Economy and Financial Economy; Entrepreneurship; Law and Management, 11 (66), pp. 27-30; (2017) Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation, , http://ac.gov.ru/files/publication/a/12824.pdf, Available at:, Accessed 20 February 2018; Becker, G.S., (1976) The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Cahuc, P., Search, flows, job creations and destructions (2014) Labour Economics, 30 (C), pp. 22-29; Gimpelson, V.E., Does the Russian economy need human capital?

At the same time, the existing regulatory mechanisms and legislation do not create optimal conditions for the development of the market of new financial instruments and technologies in Russia today. There are socio-economic risks, the key ones including an increase in the outflow of capital and innovative projects to other countries, a lack of confidence on the part of potential investors in new financial instruments, a decrease in the stability of traditional financial institutions. On this basis, the following tasks have been set in this article. To consider the terminology in the field of digital economy from the theoretical aspect; to identify trends and justify the need for digitalization of economic processes based on the use of new financial technologies; to reveal the informative characteristics of financial technologies promising for Russia. This article ends with a conclusion that the development of the digital economy in Russia is due to the need to ensure the information and economic security of the state, realize the potential of the new economy to improve the standard of living and national well-being through the introduction of innovative communication and financial technologies. The impact of the “digital economy” on socio-economic processes is multifaceted.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by incumbent firms' business. This study is a pioneer study investigating the impact of fintech startups on incumbent firms' performance. Incumbent firms involved in this study are rural bank, commercial bank, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by employing net loan to assets while profit was assessed by employing return on assets. This study was conducted in Indonesia by involving all incumbent firms registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange and Financial Service Authority. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after fintech startup emerged. The study reveals that fintech startup disrupts incumbent firms' business because incumbent firms' total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural bank and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of fintech startup does not occur in commercial bank.

In recent years, the rise of FinTechs has attracted much attention since they challenge incumbent financial service companies including the traditional banking model. In this paper, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Therefore, we develop a taxonomy of FinTech business models following a theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach for identifying and defining underlying business model elements. After developing our taxonomy, we use a clustering-based approach to identify business model archetypes on which to showcase our results, reexamine the assumptions made during taxonomy development, and validate the presented findings. Based on the gained insights, we discuss implications for research, practice and policy makers, as well as directions for future research.","Digital business model; Digital transformation; E-finance; Financial technology; FinTech; Taxonomy","Finance; Business modeling; Business models; Digital business; Digital transformation; E finances; Financial service; FinTech; Policy makers; Taxonomies",,,,,"Alt, R., Puschmann, T., The Rise of Customer-Oriented Banking - Electronic Markets Are Paving the Way for Change in the Financial Industry (2012) Electronic Markets, 22 (4), pp. 203-215; Alt, R., Zimmermann, H.-D., Introduction to Special Section - Business Models (2001) Electronic Markets, 11 (1), pp. 1019-6781; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, p. 2676553. , SSRN; Avizienis, A., Laprie, J.-C., Randell, B., Landwehr, C., Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of Dependable and Secure Computing (2004) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 1 (1), pp. 11-33; Bajorat, A.M., (2016) German Fintech Overview, , http://paymentandbanking.com/german-fintech-overview-unbundling-banks/, Retrieved 11/08/2016, from; Bakos, Y., The Emerging Role of Electronic Marketplaces on the Internet (1998) Communications of The ACM, 41 (8), pp. 35-42; Benner, M.J., Ranganathan, R., Offsetting Illegitimacy?

Across Europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes. Traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment. In some Member States, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole. Within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (Fintechs). Whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country. Unlike for the harmonisation of EU rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework. Likewise, the establishment of the Banking Union and the prudential supervision of the Euro-area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies. The many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organisations managing the data system (the Data Brokers). This is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the dissemination and sharing of traditional and non-traditional data, as well as from their expanding uses. This is an area of the EU internal market that demands the attention of the EU legislator without further delays. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Consumer law and policy; Credit data & big data; EU market integration; Fundamental rights; Retail financial markets",,,,,,"Facilitating Access to Finance - Discussion Paper on Credit Information Sharing, , https://www1.oecd.org/globalrelations/45370071.pdf; Should the availability of UK credit data be improved?

Digital innovation leads to challenges for incumbent firms in adapting to changing rules set by new competitors and higher customer expectations. However, young firms providing technical solutions for the financial services industry (fintechs) also face difficulties; for instance, in meeting high regulatory requirements. Increasing alliances in the financial services industry can be observed due to shortcom- ings on the side of banks and fintechs. We conducted interviews to examine the motives of these alliance partners. The resulting motives are categorized as matching, comple- mentary, and neutral. We derive practical implications in the form of recommendations for alliances, and deliver theoretical insights regarding criteria for digital-innovation- based alliances. © 2018 University of Maribor Press.","Digital innovation; Digitalization; Fintechs; Motives","Customer expectation; Digital innovations; Digitalization; Financial services industries; Fintechs; Motives; Regulatory requirements; Technical solutions",,,,,"Bai, Y., O’Brien, G.C., The strategic motives behind firm’s engagement in cooperative research and development (2008) Journal of Modelling in Management, 3 (2), pp. 162-181; Basit, T., Manual or electronic? the role of coding in qualitative data analysis (2003) Educational Research, 45 (2), pp. 143-154; Bengtsson, M., Kock, S., Coopetition” in business networks—to cooperate and compete simultaneously (2000) Industrial Marketing Management, 29 (5), pp. 411-426; Bocks, B., (2017) Die Jungen Wilden Werden Erwachsen, , https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/fintechs/bank-it/die-jungen-wilden-werden-solangsam-reifer-fintechs-wachsen-lang/15144350, Retrieved February 14, 2018, from; Brandl, B., Hornuf, L., Where did fintechs come from, and where do they go?

These FinTechs provide financial products and services using different technologies covering various financial areas including lending/ financing. For instance, Peer-to-Business (P2B) financing platforms are one of FinTech solutions which has been growing rapidly in the past few years making many governments setting regulations to cater this trend.Bahrain is one of the countries that has issued number of regulations for FinTech activities including for Shariah Compliant P2B financing platforms. These types of platforms shall provide Islamic financing solutions for SMEs. However, as a new financial solution in the market it is expected to face some challenges in term SMEs adoption. Therefore, this research aims at building a conceptual framework for the strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain. The framework is built based on different sources of academic literature in domain space of Islamic Finance and FinTech (Islamic FinTech), in addition to theories like Technology Acceptance Model and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The framework variables will be examined through mixed research method approach covering case study, semi-structured interviews, and an online survey. The research outcome shall be a strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain to ensure the adoption of SMEs to these platforms. © BEIESP.","FinTech; Islamic Finance; P2B lending; SMEs",,,,,,"(2015) Concept of Waqf under Muslim Law, , https://www.lawctopus.com/academike/concept-waqf-muslim-law/, online, Accessed 5 Sep; Achsien, I., Purnamasari, D., Islamic Crowd-funding as The Next Financial Innovation in Islamic Finance: Potential and Anticipated Regulation in Indonesia (2016) European Journal of Islamic Finance, , http://www.ojs.unito.it/index.php/EJIF/article/view/1771/1611, [Accessed 5 Sep. 2017]; Al Kindy, A., Shah, I., Jusoh, A., Consideration and Methodological Approaches in Studying Transformational Leadership Impact on Work Performance Behaviors (2016) International Journal of Advanced Research, 4 (1). , http://www.journalijar.com/uploads/755_IJAR-8565.pdf, online, Accessed 1 Jul. 2017; Al-Hamidy, A., ARAB MONETARY FUND STATMENT (2017) G-24 Ministerial Meeting, , https://www.g24.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DG-statement_G24.pdf, [online] ARAB MONETARY FUND, [Accessed 16 Aug. 2017]; Cann, O., Fintech Companies Hold Key to $2 trillion SME Funding Gap (2015) World Economic Forum, , https://www.weforum.org/press/2015/10/fintech-companies-hold-key-to-2-trillion-sme-funding-gap/, online, Accessed 16 Aug. 2017; Cao, W., (2016) Fintech Acceptance Research in Finland-Case Company Plastc, , Masters.

An ecosystem's ability to attract new firms and to continuously evolve is of strategic importance for incumbent companies as well as for those who decide to join the ecosystem. In our study, we analyzed the business models of 286 international fintechs and banks. Based on this analysis, we present seven types of business models in which fintechs and banks collaborate. With these types, we contribute to research on fintechs by providing novel insights on how the ecosystem moves from competition among banks towards coopetition between banks and fintechs. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

In order to realize a cashless society, each country adopts mobile payment method as its main policy objective. It is actively promoting regulations and alleviating regulations. This is a very important task. Since the mobile easy payment services are still in the infancy phase, it is being investigated that the acceptance rate among the layers is various. Through previous researches, it was confirmed that the most important factor affecting the intention of using mobile easy payment service was perceived usefulness, and the factors influencing perceived usefulness were classified as personal characteristics, service characteristics, environmental characteristics and service characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people with experience using mobile easy payment service will continue to use the service in the future and what factors influence the intention to use the service continuously. The results of the study showed that the variables of personal characteristics and service characteristics influenced the intention to use continuously in the future through perceived usefulness. In addition, it has been found that the various gaps between the layers are important factors in the future intention of mobile payment service. According to the results of this study, the important national task in spreading mobile payment service is suggesting that how to resolve the smart divide and the income gap is an important policy task. © 2018 SERSC Australia.","FinTech; Income divide; Mobile easy payment service; Smart divide; TAM",,,,,,"Davis, F.D., (1989) 'Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology', , MIS Quarterly; Rogers, E.M., (2003) 'Diffusion of Innovations', , 5th edition, Free Press; Bandura, A., 'Self-efficacy; Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change' (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Thompson, R.L., Higgins, C.A., Howell, J.M., 'Personal Computing: Toward a conceptual Model of Utilization' (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (1), pp. 125-143; Pham, T.T.T., Ho, J.C., 'The Effects of Product-Related, Personal-Related Factors and Attractiveness of Alternatives on Consumer Adoption of NFC-based Mobile Payments' (2015) Technology in Society, 43, pp. 1-16; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., 'Evaluating Structural Equation Models with Unobservable Variables and Measurement Error' (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18 (1), pp. 39-50; Hair, J.F., Jr., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., (2010) 'Multivariate Data Analysis', , 7th edition, pearson Hall; Davis, F.D., 'User acceptance of Information technology: system characteristics, user perception and behavioral impacts' (1993) International journal of man-machine studies, 38 (3), pp. 475-487; Chandrika, G., 'Study on Software Reliability and Reliability Testing' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (1), pp. 7-20. , March; Peddigari, R., 'Impact of User Ratings on Mobile Apps Due Fault and Change Proneness in API' (2015) Asiapacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (2), pp. 43-59. , June; Hyun Kim, J., Sekhar Reddy, R., 'Implementation of Mobile Apps Across Globe and Challenge to Software Engineering' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (3), pp. 1-16. , September; Hee Lee, J., Raj, K., 'Hybrid Data Management in Cloud Security' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (4), pp. 33-39. , December; Udayini, A., 'An Approach for Routing Queries in P2P Networks' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (1), pp. 7-12; Krishna, L., 'Authenticated Searching Multi Key word in the Cloud Computing' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (1), pp. 29-36. , March; Sai Raaga Sowmya, T., 'Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centres' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (4), pp. 33-41. , December; Bansal, M., Shricastava, L., 'Performance Analysis of Wireless Mobile Adhoc Network with Different Types of Antennas' (2017) HSST, 3 (1), pp. 33-44. , March; lgbaria, M., Livari, J., 'The effects of self-efficacy on computer usage' (1995) Omega, 23 (6), pp. 587-605","Han, K.S.; School of Business Administration, Soongsil UniversitySouth Korea; email: kshan@ssu.ac.kr",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

It identifies FinTech’s evolution in Asia across Deposits & lending, Capital Raising, Investment Management, Market provisioning, Payments, and Insurance. This technology revolution allows us to have a banking system based on values that serve customers better, reduce risk to the society and improve returns for the shareholders. Data on unbanked population, smartphone penetration, and Internet penetration has led to retail side innovations such as Mobile Wallets, P2P Payments, and Real-time Payments in the most of Asia (except China). A total of 49% of Global Investments in FinTech are in Asia and the Chinese dragon alone accounts for 46%. India is witnessing a strong amount of FinTech deals in 2017 and it is being driven by payment and lending solutions. ASEAN FinTech industry is dominated by m-wallets and online payments; this is followed by retail investment and financial comparison. The chapter dives into the challenges Asian banks are facing because of this disruption. Now more than ever, is the important role governments and central banks of each nation play to assess the path these start-ups are headed on and this will unfold the landscape of banking in Asia a few years down the lane. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity. Customers are interested in new and more convenient functionality in mobile applications, and they are waiting for new value propositions, including fast international money transfers, roboadvising, personal financial management, peer-to-peer lending. © 2018 Vladimir I.

The preliminary results suggest that professionals with financial job title or work experiences in finance industry are more likely to switch to a FinTech job. Meanwhile, the finance or computing major also has a positive effect on switching to a FinTech job. Further analysis shows that FinTech professionals in FinTech startups and FinTech incumbent firms exhibit significant different human capital characteristics, which indicates that startups put more attention to IT workers's leadership and prior startup experience while FinTech incumbent firms focus more on IT techniques and IT educational background when hiring employees. More interestingly, both of the FinTech startups and incumbent firms prefer hiring professionals with either specialized finance or computing background rather than those with both financial and computing backgrounds.

The expansion of FinTech industry has encouraged the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. A study has been conducted to assess the blockchain, cryptocurrency and FinTech market growth. This paper provides empirical evidence on the factors influencing the market growth in Malaysia and highlights the factors that could spur and hinder its future use. A survey of 304 blockchain users and industry players in Malaysia was conducted and quantitative results revealed that privacy is the most significant barrier to the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Other barriers include those related to legality, cost, security, and stability, as well as difficulties in switching to a new technology. Thus, government regulation is needed to provide guidelines for ensuring the sustainability and growth of this technology in the near future. In addition, results demonstrate that the banking sector is going to be the most affected by the FinTech industry. This current trend may assist the decision makers in evaluating the potential usage of this technology, allowing them to make strategic decisions to improve business and services. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The results of the study show that fintech is more than just a phenomenon, it cannot be compared to other start-ups, and has the potential to fundamentally change the business and economic landscape. © Nofie Iman, 2018","Adoption; Financial services; Financial technology; Innovation",,,,,,"Bryman, A., Bell, E., (2007) Business Research Methods, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cassell, C., Symon, G., (2004) Essential Guide to Qualitative Methods in Organizational Research, , London: SAGE Publications; Christensen, C., (1997) The Innovator’S Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Coase, R., The nature of the firm (1937) Economica, 4 (16), pp. 386-405. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, , London: SAGE Publications Ltd; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; (2017) Mobile Phones in Indonesia, , www.euromonitor.com/mobile-phones-in-indonesia/report, Retrieved from accessed on August 5, 2018; (2017) A Definition by FinTech Weekly, , https://www.fintechweekly.com/fintech-definition, Retrieved from accessed on March 29, 2017; Gawer, A., Cusumano, M., (2002) Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; (2014) The Global Findex Database: Indonesia, , http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/country/indonesia, Retrieved from accessed on August 5, 2018; Hung, J.L., Luo, B., Fintech in Taiwan: A case study of a Bank’s strategic planning for an investment in a FinTech company (2016) Financial Innovation, 2 (1), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-016-0037-6; Jensen, M.C., Meckling, W.H., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (4), pp. 305-360. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X; Katz, M., Shapiro, S., Network externalities, competition and compatibility (1985) American Economic Review, 75, pp. 424-440. , http://idv.sinica.edu.tw/kongpin/teaching/io/KatzShapiro1.pdf, Retrieved from; Liebowitz, S.J., Margolis, S.E., Network externality: An uncommon tragedy (1994) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 8, pp. 133-150. , https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.8.2.133; Riemer, K., Hafermalz, E., Roosen, A., Boussand, N., El Aoufi, H., Mo, D., Kosheliev, A., (2017) The Fintech Advantage: Harnessing Digital Technology, Keeping The Customer in Focus, , https://www.capgemini.com/au-en/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/the_fintech_ad-vantage.pdf, University of Sydney, Business School and Capgemini; Rochet, J.-C., Tirole, J., Platform competition in two-sided markets (2003) Journal of The European Economic Association, 1 (4), pp. 990-1029. , https://doi.org/10.1162/154247603322493212; (2017) Definition of Fintech in English by Oxford Dictionaries, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fintech, Retrieved from accessed on March 29, 2017; (2017) Digital in Southeast Asia in 2017, , https://wearesocial.com/special-reports/digital-southeast-asia-2017, Retrieved from accessed on March 4, 2018; Williamson, O.E., Transaction cost economics: The governance of contractual relations (1979) Journal of Law and Economics, 22 (2), pp. 233-261. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/466942; Williamson, O.E., The economics of organization: The transaction cost approach (1981) American Journal of Sociology, 87 (3), pp. 548-577. , https://doi.org/10.1086/227496; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., FinTech – What’s in a name?

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company","Digital finance; Financial services market; Financial supervision; Financial technologies; FinTech; InsurTech; Investment",,,,,,"(2018) Real Estate Market in Armenia, , http://www.avenueconsulting.am/reports/download/42/Real_Estate_Mar-ket_in_Armenia:_Outlook_2018.html, Retrieved from; Global Charts, , https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/, n.d; (2017) Vision 2020 for FinTech and Non-Bank Regulation, , https://www.csbs.org/vision2020, Retrieved from; Perkins, D.W., (2018) Marketplace Lending: FinTech in Consumer and Small-Business Lending, , https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44614.pdf, Retrieved from; (2018) InsurThech Entering Its Second Wave, , https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Docu-ments/financial-services/us-dcfs-insurtech-entering-second-wave.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Armenian ICT Sector Enterprise Incubator Foundation, , http://www.eif.am/eng/researches/report-on-the-state-of-the-industry/, n.d; (2018) The Future of FinTech and Financial Services, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-the-future-of-FinTech-and-financial-services-whats-the-next-big-bet/$FILE/EY-the-future-of-FinTech-and-financial-services-whats-the-next-big-bet.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Global Insurance M&A Themes, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-gloal-insurance-themes-2017/$FILE/ey-gloal-insurance-themes-2017.pdf, Young n.d; https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/fca-innovate, ); (2015) Supervisory Insight, , https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/siwin15/si_winter2015.pdf, Retrieved from; (2016) Prepaid Accounts Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth In Lending Act (Regulation Z), , https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-24503/prepaid-accounts-under-the-electronic-fund-transfer-act-regulation-e-and-the-truth-in-lending-act, Retrieved from; (2016) FinTech Ecosystem in Ukraine, , Future magazine; (2017) FinTech Has Not a Trend Yet, , Future magazine; Godin, S., (2016) Permissive Marketing: How to Make a Friend of A Stranger, and Turn It into A Buyer, , https://www.amazon.com/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360, Retrieved from; Hileman, G., Rauchs, M., (2017) Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study, , https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Regulatory Innovation Plan, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach-ment_data/file/606953/HM_Trea-sury_Regulatory_Innovation_Plan.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) FinTech and Financial Services: Initial Considerations, , https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2017/sdn1705.ashx.28, Retrieved from; Horsley, J.P., (2017) Guiding Opinions on Promoting Development of the Sharing Economy, , http://www.chinalawtranslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-7-28-Sharing-Economy-Opin-ions-JPH-Tr.pdf, Retrieved from; Gogo, J., (2018) $50 Million Bitcoin Mining Farm Opens in Armenia, , https://news.bitcoin.com/50-million-bitcoin-mining-farm-opens-in-armenia/, Retrieved from; Day, J., (2017) The OCC's Responsible Innovation Framework and FinTech Bank Charters - Latest Developments, , http://www.jonesday.com/files/Publication/0ca79769-65e5-40f8-b7e5-12354198ba73/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/7ab2c44a-3ac5-403f-b1aa-2ac654ad79cb/OCC%20Responsible%20Inno-vation%20Framework.pdf, Retrieved from; Kim, W.C., Moborn, R., (2016) Blue Ocean Strategy.

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period. By transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency. The results show high potential of FinTech for cross-border payment processing. © Yuriy Petrushenko.","Digital economy; Financial innovations; Financial services; Financial sphere; Financial technologies; Payment methods; Start-up; Venture",,,,,,"(2017) Top 10 Trends in Financial Services, , https://aitegroup.com/sites/default/files/storage_0/20170105_Top%2010%20Trends%20in%20Financial%20Services%202017.pdf, Retrieved December 28, 2017 from; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New PostCrisis Paradigm?; Barr, M., Klifford, K., Klein, A., (2018), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/es_20180413_fintech_access.pdf, The Brookings Institution.

Moreover, digital finance has forged the convergence of profit motives with social objectives creating a class of large FinTech companies. In addition, the underlying technology innovation may be applied to a wide range of industries, not limited to financial sector. Yet, few researches have been done to study these phenomena. Hence, it is the task of this book to shed light on the introduction and trends in FinTech, blockchain and token sales. Richly illustrated with original lecture slides taught by the authors, Inclusive FinTech: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and ICO hopes to dispel the many misconceptions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, Initial Crypto-Token Offering or ICO), as well as the idea that businesses can be sustainable without a social dimension going forward. With comprehensive coverage given to the FinTech scene in Asia, it is targeted at those who are searching for business opportunities. Most important of all, this book seeks to change the mindset of a whole new generation that is familiar with digital economy and yearns for a more just and equitable world. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

In particular, some typical examples of applying blockchain in Financial Technology (FinTech) are discussed, including such as applying Bitcoin to drive various new business services, and implementing smart contracts based on blockchain technology to oversee the execution of legal transactions in real time. In addition, a pioneer effort of building up a distributed-ledger consortium model is addressed in the near future work. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Bitcoin; Business agreement; Business Process; Business service; Financial services industries; ITS applications; Real time; Smart contracts; Blockchain",,,,,"Merkle, R.C., A digital signature based on a conventional encryption function (1988) CRYPTO 1987.

The success of the intuitive Sandbox has however led to it being replicated in jurisdictions worldwide, eager to benefit from the growth of FinTech. Competition for high-calibre start-ups means the UK’s post-Brexit Sandbox may need to go further than its existing FinTech Sector Strategy to continuing attracting and developing firms helping the City of London to remain the global centre of finance as perceived in the UK’s Industrial Strategy. The article examines existing regulations and analyses how the UK can develop an enhanced structure to both further attract and accommodate legitimate high-calibre FinTech entrepreneurs, whilst offering strong client and investor protections to ensure financial stability. It proposes unprecedented legal and policy reforms for the Sandbox structure, including a permissible model to capitalise on funding from amateur private investors worldwide. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","financial technology; initial coin offerings; Sandbox",,,,,,"Adhami, S., Giudici, G., Martinazzi, S., Why do Businesses go Crypto?

Following genetics, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves, the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neuronS. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex Deep Learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generationS. The presented algorithm and Deep Learning structure has been applied and validated in a Fintech Model; a Smart Investment application where an Intelligent Bankers are specialised in Buy and sell decisions on several Assets, Markets and RiskS. The obtained results are promising; the proposed model combines human brain and genetics with Deep Learning structure based on the Random Neural Network model where biology; similar as Artificial Intelligence is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment. © 2018 The Author(s).","Deep Learning Clusters;

So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018.

Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the meantime, the digital finance boom has created serious concerns and challenges for Chinese regulators in relation to issues such as financial stability, consumer protection, illegal financial activities, etc. To address these issues, the Chinese government has committed to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation and supervision of DFS and has taken a balanced approach whereby the promotion of DFS will continue under such a framework so as to ensure the sustainable development of DFS. The major challenges ahead are to ensure the regulatory framework has the potential to deal with new forms of DFS and new problems associated with DFS, and to balance the regulation of DFS with its healthy growth. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever. Ensuring a level playing field for consumers that live in rural locations or regions without the structures of an urban economy is vital in achieving full financial and social inclusion. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Basing on its existing ""balanced"" approach in promoting financial development and ensuring a safe and sound financial sector, and in sync with its objective to harness technology to improve the efficiency of the financial markets, the paper elaborates on the insights of MAS' policy intent in regulating the FinTech sector. The paper then focuses on MAS' proposed ""Regulatory Sandbox"" - an innovative regulatory framework which helps to strike a good balance between creating a conducive environment for financial innovation and on the other hand protecting financial consumers and ensuring financial stability. In closing, the paper shares some thought of the writer on MAS' approach and the likely future development of MAS' financial regulation towards financial technology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article defines SocialTech as organizations that represent the intersection between Social Enterprises and Fintech. As Fintech's classifications exclude the social dimension and categorizations of social entrepreneurship activities exclude the dimension of technology, we propose a SocialTech classification that considers both technological aspects and social entrepreneurship activity.

As the battle over the Chinese mobile wallet market wages on, the gap between leading players WeChat Pay (owned by Tencent) and Alipay remains narrow. Based on brand equity theory and symbolic value theory, a research model is proposed to investigate the relationship between Fintech's technology leadership, brand equity, and customer loyalty. The results show that Alipay provides more innovative and diversified financial services and outperforms WeChat Pay in technology leadership. The study confirms that technology leadership positively affects brand equity, which in turn positively affects customer loyalty. The boundary condition for different type of customers is considered and implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The authors defined the main features of FinTech platforms underlining types of FinTech, its participants and the most influential factors. The main trends of FinTech platforms development in the EU countries, such as the level of investment, impact of EU FinTech platforms on the global scale, features of investments into B2B FinTech, were determined. It was considered that in Ukraine, some positive changes in legislation were adopted, but the challenges like lack of finance, slow adoption of innovations in the financial market, not sufficient clarity of legislation remain among the main constraints for further development of FinTech platforms in Ukraine. The conducted analysis on the level of FinTech types performance by Ukrainian platforms showed only the great share of digital payments and money transfers, while other modern innovative FinTech instruments should not be underestimated for proper FinTech application in Ukraine. For this purpose, the authors have developed the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations that consolidates interests of both SMEs and scientists. To determine both the SMEs’ opinion about the necessity of a particular Internet platform for them and the types of services that could be provided by the sme-sci.com platform, the authors conducted a survey in which 374 medium-sized and 380 small businesses took part. The results of the survey that are presented in the article confirm the necessity of the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations and demand for it from the SMEs. Finally, the result of the research proves that such a unique informational platform as sme-sci. com that will serve as an interactive field for exchanging ideas and information of both representatives of scientific and business world is of great importance. © Alla Ivashchenko, Igor Britchenko, Mykhailo Dyba, Yevheniia Polishchuk, Yuliia Sybirianska, Yurii Vasylyshen, 2018","Crowdfunding; Equity funding; FinTech platforms; Information platforms; New technologies; P2P lending",,,,,,"Antoniuk, L., Barriers and opportunities for hi-tech innovative small and medium enterprises development in the 4th industrial revolution era (2017) Problems and Perspectives in Management, 15 (4), pp. 100-113. , https://doi.org/10.21511/ppm.15(4).2017.09; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2676553, University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper, 2015/047; UNSW Law Research Paper 2016-62; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., Regtech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2847806, Forthcoming; University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper 2016/035); Caytas, J., Developing blockchain real-time clearing and settlement in the EU, U.S., and Globally (2016) Columbia Journal of European Law: Preliminary Reference, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2807675, June 22, 2016); (2018) Crowdfunding for SMEs, , www.smedevelopment.info/searchfinance/3/, Retrieved from; Dhar, V., Stein, R., (2016) FinTech Platforms and Strategy, pp. 5183-5216. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2892098, MIT Sloan Research Paper; He, D., (2017) Fintech and Financial Services: Initial Considerations; Dorfleitner, G., Hornuf, L., Schmitt, M., Weber, M., (2016) The Fintech Market in Germany, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2885931, Springer International Publishing; (2017) EY FinTech Adoption Index (Report), , http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAs-sets/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017/$FILE/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017.pdf, Ernst and Young; (2018) FinTech Action Plan: For A More Competitive and Innovative European Financial Sector (Report), , https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/180308-action-plan-fintech_en, European Commission; Fenwick, M., McCahery, J., Vermeulen, E., Fintech and the financing of entrepreneurs: From crowdfunding to marketplace lending (2017) Lex Research Topics in Corporate Law & Economics Working, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2967891, TILEC Discussion Paper 2017-25; ECGI – Law Working Paper 369/2017; Paper 2017-3; (2018) FinTech Action Plan: For A More Competitive and Innovative European Financial Sector, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109, Retrieved from; (2017) State of European FinTech: Current Trends & Prediction, , https://www.slideshare.net/innovatefinance/state-of-european-fintech-current-trends-prediction-2017, FinTech Growth Forum; Haddad, C., Hornuf, L., (2016) The Emergence of The Global Fintech Market: Economic and Technological Determinants, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2830124, CESifo Working Paper Series 6131).

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generations. This proposed structure has been applied and validated in Fintech; a Smart Investment application: an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Assets with an associated market and risk.

This consequently puts the financial services industry under additional pressure and constant growing competition from the financial sector participants, from large technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, from large FinTech companies such as PayPal, Moven, TransferWise, mobile network operators and other existing and potential market players. The implementation of the new EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2), which allows non-financial companies to provide access to financial services for bank customers, is expected to disrupt the financial services industry as we know it, and make traditional financial services providers and banks, in particular, think of new creative business models to remain competitive. In the process of doing this, changing the landscape of payments and creating new risks for banking business. With this study we aim to assess the new EU Payment Service regulation in the context of industry competitiveness. The study is based on the examination of the PSD2 Directive exploring the opportunities as well as the risks that it will bring to this industry in the near future, and the possibilities of cooperation of the financial services industry with financial technology developers. Moreover, we analyse structured data, collected from a questionnaire based on 4 themes of perception of techs on the importance they have on ensuring competitiveness, conducted with European tech companies. Most of the questionnaire participants believe that the Payment Services Directive 2 will promote competitiveness, innovations and development. Moreover, findings show that comparativeness is related mainly to low costs and customer satisfaction. However, it is also shown that high quality of products/services as well as relatively high speed of transactions and security, privacy and risk are also perceived as important. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

So far, various factors of FinTech venture success have been explored, but there is little empirical insight through the lens of business model theory. To close this gap, we build on a FinTech business model taxonomy and examine 221 FinTech companies in order to statistically infer crucial business model determinants responsible for FinTech venture success. Our findings show that the business model component ""Product/Service Offering"" is the most important determinant for the success of a FinTech venture. © 2018 Universitatsverlag Gottingen.

It provides broad contexts for understanding financial services, products, technology, regulations and social considerations. The book shows how FinTech has evolved and will drive the future of financial services, while other FinTech books concentrate on particular solutions and adopt perspectives of individual users, companies and investors.

Specifically, the consumers' attitude towards FinTech products in the context of Malaysia remain unexplored by most of the studies. This preliminary study proposed the extension of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as to identify the potential factors that influence consumers' intention to adopt FinTech products and services in Malaysia. This study reviewed five factors as independent variables, namely the usefulness, ease of use, competitive advantage, perceived risk, and perceived cost; in line with the mediating effect of attitude towards using FinTech products and intention to adopt FinTech products served as the dependent variable. This study attempts to create new knowledge geared towards behaviour to utilize FinTech products in Malaysia. © 2018 Authors.","Consumers attitude; Financial services; FinTech; Technology; Technology Acceptance Model",,,,,,"Al-Fahim, N.H., An Examination Factors Influencing The Intention To Adopt Internet Banking Among Smes In Yemen: Us-ing An Extension Of The Technology Acceptance Model (Tam) (2016) Journal Of Internet Banking And Commerce, 21, p. 1; Bagozzi, F.D.D.R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User Acceptance Of Computer Technology: A Comparison Of Two Theoretical Models (1989) Management Science, 35 (8); Chuang, L.-M., Liu, C.-C., Kao, H.-K., The adoption of fintech service: TAM perspective (2016) Int J Manag Adm Sci, 3, pp. 1-15; Cox, D.F., Rich, S.U., Perceived risk and consumer de-cision-making: The case of telephone shopping (1964) Journal of market-ing research, pp. 32-39; Kim, Y., Park, Y.-J., Choi, J., Yeon, J., An Empirical Study on the Adoption of ""Fintech"" Service: Focused on Mobile Payment Services (2015) Advanced Science and Technology Letters, 114 (26), pp. 136-140; Kleijnen, M., Wetzels, M., De Ruyter, K., Consumer ac-ceptance of wireless finance (2004) Journal of financial services market-ing, 8 (3), pp. 206-217; Krishanan, D., Khin, A.A., Teng, K.L.L., Attitude to-wards using mobile banking in Malaysia: a conceptual framework (2015) methods, 11, p. 12; Kuo, Y.-F., Yen, S.-N., Towards an understanding of the behavioral intention to use 3G mobile value-added services (2009) Com-puters in human behavior, 25 (1), pp. 103-110; Lee, M.-C., Factors influencing the adoption of internet banking: An integration of TAM and TPB with perceived risk and perceived benefit (2009) Electronic commerce research and applications, 8 (3), pp. 130-141; Lee, S., User Behavior of Mobile Enterprise Applications (2016) KSII Transactions on Internet & Information Systems, 10 (8); Lu, Y., Yang, S., Chau, P.Y., Cao, Y., Dynamics be-tween the trust transfer process and intention to use mobile payment services: A cross-environment perspective (2011) Information & Man-agement, 48 (8), pp. 393-403; Luarn, P., Lin, H.-H., Toward an understanding of the behavioral intention to use mobile banking (2005) Computers in human behavior, 21 (6), pp. 873-891; Martins, C., Oliveira, T., Popovic, A., Understanding the Internet banking adoption: A unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and perceived risk application (2014) International journal of information management, 34 (1), pp. 1-13; Muk, A., Chung, C., Applying the technology acceptance model in a two-country study of SMS advertising (2015) Journal of Busi-ness Research, 68 (1), pp. 1-6; Shih, Y.-Y., Fang, K., The use of a decomposed theory of planned behavior to study Internet banking in Taiwan (2004) Internet re-search, 14 (3), pp. 213-223; Singapore, F., (2017) Top 10 Fintech (Startups) in Malaysia, , http://fintechnews.sg/7899/malaysia/top-10-fintech-startups-malaysia/, Jan 13; (2017) Potential users for FinTech product in Malay-sia, , https://www.statista.com/outlook/295/122/fintech/malaysia#; Tan, M., Teo, T.S., Factors influencing the adoption of Internet banking (2000) Journal of the AIS, 1 (1), p. 5. , ES; Tarhini, A., Hassouna, M., Abbasi, M.S., Orozco, J., Towards the Acceptance of RSS to Support Learning: An empirical study to validate the Technology Acceptance Model in Lebanon (2015) Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 13 (1), pp. 30-41; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) MANAGEMENT SCIENCE, 46 (2), pp. 186-204; Wu, J.-H., Wang, S.-C., What drives mobile commerce?: An empirical evaluation of the revised technology acceptance mod-el (2005) Information & Management, 42 (5), pp. 719-729; Yiu, C.S., Grant, K., Edgar, D., Factors affecting the adoption of Internet Banking in Hong Kong-implications for the banking sector (2007) International journal of information management, 27 (5), pp. 336-351","Cheng, L.S.; Universiti Tunku Abdul RahmanMalaysia; email: lowsc@utar.edu.my",,,"Science Publishing Corporation Inc",,,,,2227524X,,,,"English","Int.

Furthermore, the study analyses if the type of service and the geographical area could have some effect on the level of disclosure. The diversity of issues disclosed on the Internet is categorized in items grouped in self-constructed indices in order to identify the structure of the financial and non-financial information reported and furthermore to quantify the volume of disclosure. The empirical study is based on the analysis of the information reported by companies included in two FinTech top-list. Thus, the sample includes 91 businesses from Europe, Asia and North America. The results of the indices indicate that the total volume of information provided on the website is less than the amount reported in other sectors and other type of businesses. The findings also suggest that there are not any effects due to the type of service or the geographical area, effects traditionally associated in the literature with a major or a minor level of disclosure. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Digital financial services; Disclosure indices; FinTech; FinTech disclosure; FinTech information; FinTech market","Finance; Disclosure indices; Financial service; FinTech; FinTech disclosure; FinTech information; Websites",,,,,"Aksu, M., Kosedag, A., Transparency and disclosure scores and their determinants in the istanbul stock exchange (2006) Corp.

Design/methodology/approach: Original data were collected via a survey of 243 participants with Fintech usage experience. The partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model. Findings: The results reveal that legal risk had the most negative effect on the Fintech continuance intention, while convenience had the strongest positive effect. Differences in specific benefit and risk impacts are found between early and late adopters. Originality/value: This empirical study contributes to the novel understanding of the benefit and risk factors affecting the Fintech continuance intention. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention;

Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators. Competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""Too Big to Fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation. © 2018 American Statistical Association.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Findings: The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. Practical implications: This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use. Social implications: The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future. Originality/value: A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber security; Data security; FinTech; Information security; Mobile banking","Customer satisfaction; Economics; Finance; Investments; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sales; Security of data; User interfaces; Cyber security; Design/methodology/approach; FinTech; Information technology infrastructure; Mobile application securities; Mobile bankings; Technology acceptance model; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior: organizational behavior and human decision processes (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Allen, M.J., Yen, W.M., (2002) Introduction to Measurement Theory, , Waveland Press, Long Grove, IL; Amoroso, D.L., Hunsinger, D.S., Understanding consumers’ acceptance of online purchasing (2009) Journal of Information Technology Management, 10 (1), pp. 15-41; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.C., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Ashley, P., Boyd, P., Quantitative and qualitative approaches to research in environmental management (2006) Australasian Journal of Environmental Management, 13 (2), pp. 70-78; Berger, J.R., Sasse, M.A., (2001) Trustbuilders and trustbusters: the role of trust cues in interface to e-commerce applications, , www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Riegelsberger/trustbuilders_and_trustbusters.htm, (accessed: 17 August 2016; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Statistics notes: Cronbach’s alpha (1997) BMJ, 314 (7080). , http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.314.7080.572; Burns, N., Grove, S.K., (2001) The Practice of Nursing Research: Conduct, Critique, and Utilization, , Saunders, Philadelphia, PA; Carlson, J.W., (2015) Testimony on behalf of the Fin.

Most of the Fintech firms tend to be platform-based businesses, but yet, the process of Fintech Platform Development has not been studied to a significant degree. Toward tackling this knowledge gap, this research-in-progress paper presents an ongoing case study that is investigating the development of a Fintech platform that provides instalment-based retail services and microloans to students and youths in China. From our findings to date, a preliminary process model is presented that suggests that the process of Fintech Platform Development can traverse across three sequential stages: Value Definition, Stakeholder Empowerment and Co-Evolution. Each of the stages are marked by the employment of various platform development strategies, which in turn, leads to a number of distinct platform configurations.","Case study; Fintech; Platform development; Tech startup","Co-evolution; Customer experience; Fintech; Knowledge gaps; Platform development; Process Modeling; Retail services",,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospects of a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm?

Our findings indicate that P2P lending platforms align their value facilitating practices to the unique needs of their multiple user groups (i.e., borrowers and lenders), and highlight the purpose, content, and economic actors targeted by each P2P lending platform.

The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption. Incumbents’ preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation. Our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular. Specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory. We hypothesize that our participants’ preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy. We propose a framework for creating a financial services platform embedded in a broader ecosystem to facilitate the bank-fintech collaboration. © 2017, University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

The new patterns of financial inclusion rely on digital technologies, and “fin-tech” continues to revolutionize the nature of provision. Very important fact is that 78% of access on financial services in developing countries involves mobile money. Financial digital technologies improve data transmission, analysis and give the small companies the opportunity to develop low-cost distribution models and risk-management practices. Taking into account that there are two major reason for financial exclusion - high cost and non price barriers, we are encourage to examine the necessity of managing the use of finance digital technologies due to the opportunities for all of society. Further, we examine these questions because bureaucracy and cost are some of main barriers in accessing banking and financial products and services by biggest part of society, using linear regression analysis to process the collected data. © 2017, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Subsequent work primarily focused on the cryptocurrency, bitcoin, because its creator, programmer Satoshi Nakamoto first published a white paper and coded what is now known as blockchain technology to solve the double spending problem. More recently, Blockchain Technology has made significant advances in the fields of insurance, medical records, and the internet of things (IoT). However, the power of Blockchain Technology to solve problems in and serve as a replacement ledger of transactions in Financial Services will fundamentally transform the finance industry. This paper attempts to address the challenges that Blockchain Technology will encounter by focusing on the methodology of using Blockchain Technology to solve problems in the Financial Services Market with special attention to the use of Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Transactions. Specifically, this project will be examining the use of Blockchain Technology to drive the changes in the field of Financial Services. This paper will also discuss the future role of Blockchain Technology in teaching the various fields of Finance, and juxtapose them against traditional teaching methods in Finance, in order to reveal the increasing role that Blockchain Technology will play in the 21st-century Financial Services curriculum. This paper argues that indeed, Blockchain Technology will be able to increasingly affect how we solve various Financial Services problems and that this development will profoundly change the way the Finance curriculum is taught in the classroom. In conclusion, this project, by closely examining the role of Blockchain Technology, sheds new light on the rapidly developing changes in the Financial Services field. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.",,,,,,,"Ammous, S., (2016) Can cryptocurrencies fulfil the functions of money?, , http://capitalism.columbia.edu/files/ccs/workingpage/2017/ammous_cryptocurrencies_and_the_functions_of_money.pdf, Columbia University Center on Capitalism and Society; Harpaz, J., (2016) Will Blockchain Become the Internet of Finance?, , Forbes, May 31; https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeharpaz/2016/05/31/will-blockchain-become-the-internet-offinance/#5c4e245e3b5c; Iansiti, M., Lakhani, K.R., (2017) The Truth About Blockchain, , https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain, Harvard Business Review, February 1; (2016) How Blockchain Technology Will Disrupt Financial Service Firms, , http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/blockchaintechnology-will-disrupt-financial-services-firms/, Wharton University of Pennsylvania, May 24; Levin, D., (2016) 10 Things To Know about the Future of Blockchain in Education, , https//www.edtechstrategies.com/blog/future-blockchain-education/, EdTech Strategies, March 10, 2016; Luckin, R., Holmes, W., Griffiths, M., Forcier, L.B., (2016) Intelligence Unleashed an argument for AI in Education, , https://www.pearson.com/content/dam/corporate/global/pearson-dotcom/files/innovation/Intelligence-Unleashed-Publication.pdf; Somerville, H., (2017) London startup Blockchain raises $40 million in fresh funding, , http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-funding-idUSKBN19D2OQ, Reuters, June 23; (2015) The Promise of the Blockchain- The Trust Machine, , https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-howeconomy-works-trust-machine, The Economist, October 31; Tapscott, A., Tapscott, D., How Blockchain is Changing Finance (2017) Harvard Business Review, , https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-blockchain-is-changing-finance, March 1; Williams-Grut, O., (2016) GOLDMAN SACHS: 5 practical uses for blockchain - From Airbnb to stock markets, , http://uk.businessinsider.com/goldman-blockchain-beyond-the-hype-practical-uses-2016-5/#sharingeconomy-building-trust-on-platforms-like-airbnb-1, UK Business Insider, May 28; Yang, S., Is Bitcoin Becoming More Stable than Gold?

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).","Banks; Digital banking; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Retail banks;

We assess how security is treated by startups that provide disruptive technologies in the financial sector. In an area that has been committed to security, we find that FinTech companies have modern designs and outstanding user experience as their main priority. This strategy is rewarded by a rapidly increasing customer base but reveals a flawed understanding of security.We analyzed all aspects of security of N26, including the frontend, backend, protocols, human factors, and underlying design concepts, and found issues in all of them. We succeeded in leaking customer data, manipulating and carrying transactions and even could have entirely taken over foreign accounts. We reported these findings to N26 and did not disclose them before they were fixed. By publishing this case study, we hope to raise awareness about security considerations in the critical banking sector, especially for other FinTech startups. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Fintech companies restructure the value chain, re-bundle offerings and create new services that are to be presented and processed digitally - perhaps completely. Nevertheless, recent research with wealthy internet savvy investment customers in Germany shows that this attractive segment can be regarded as hybrid in respect of their demand for digital as well as personal asset management services and products. On the one hand wealthy internet savvy investors indicate a high level of satisfaction with advice and products from their traditional financial services partners. On the other hand they continue to search for better investment opportunities, thus showing significant demand for innovative digital banking/brokerage/advice products. Ultimately, research gives strong evidence for a high need for personal advice and human guidance. This is particularly valid when answering the question which (traditional vs. innovative) partner to choose as the future (exclusive or additional) bank, broker or financial advisor.This paper outlines the world of Fintech start-up companies, presents key findings regarding the attractive and large segment of wealthy internet savvy investors and also explores how the new Fintech conquerors as well as established banks and advisors might embrace this new business environment. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",,,,,,,"Dietz, M., Khanna, S., Olanrewaju, T., Rajgopal, K., Cutting through the noise around financial technology http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/cutting-through-the-noise-around-financial-technology, [Online].

And, it is a commonly used opening phrase for tech start-up investor presentations. Being ""disruptive"" and ""innovative"" are key ingredients for such pitch decks and are inflationary buzzwords in today's venture scene. What's often left out is being visionary and having the goal to create something substantial, something that generates a positive cash flow, building a lasting and leading business. Buzz has replaced reason in so many cases and cause has been replaced with reach, which is the usually the aim of businesses, rather than creating value. When we take a look under the hood of FinTech, we can try to see whether it is actually something - or perhaps just a way of categorizing start-ups of a specific industry. And, as FinTech is very often associated with the omnipresent discussion about crypto currencies and blockchain, we'll take a look at that too. In discussions and in keynotes the word blockchain is also used as a buzzword. Everyone else seems to hop on the same train, leaving it pretty unclear what it actually means or does - what blockchain is. Hype bears the risk of blindness for the risks and limitations there might be. It appears as if everything in IT could be replaced by blockchain these days, yet it is reasonable to believe that might not be the case at all. To start off, we will take a look at how trends have developed in digital business in recent times. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",,,,,,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology, [Online].

For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) – ‘mobile money’ – could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benefit sharing; Conservation; Economic incentives; Environmental services; Mobile payments; Transaction cost",,,,,,"Adhikari, B., Boag, G., Designing payments for ecosystem services schemes: some considerations (2013) Curr.

Authoritative settlement based on central bank support is seen as being essential for both large value and retail payment systems; and, in the EU, UK, and US, the importance of regulating for the protection of consumers who use retail payment systems is recognised. In this institutional context, payment innovations (including Bitcoin and distributed ledger or autonomous organisation technologies) are assessed. It is suggested that, while competition at certain levels is likely to bring social benefits through commercial developments, the maintenance of public interest objectives necessarily delineates the scope of competition. While this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","clearing and settlement; distributed ledger technology; payment innovation; Payment Services Directive; Payment systems; virtual currency",,,,,,,"Chiu, I.H.-Y.; Professor of Corporate Law and Financial Regulation, University College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: hse-yu.chiu@ucl.ac.uk",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,17579961,,,,"English","Law Innov.

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital Finance; e-Finance; FinTech; Future research opportunities; Literature review; State of the art",,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Catalini, C., Goldfarb, A., Crowdfunding: geography, social networks, and the timing of investment decision (2015) J Econ Manag Strat, 24 (2), pp. 253-274; Ahlers, G.K., Cumming, D., Günther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding (2015) Entrep Theory Pract, 39 (4), pp. 955-980; Allen, F., McAndrews, J., Strahan, P., E-Finance: an introduction (2002) J Financ Serv Res, 22 (1), pp. 5-27; Allison, T.H., Davis, B.C., Short, J.C., Webb, J.W., Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues (2015) Entrep Theory Pract, 39 (1), pp. 53-73; Amit, R., Zott, C., Crafting business architecture: the antecedents of business model design (2015) Strat Entrep J, 9 (4), pp. 331-350; Androutsellis-Theotokis, S., Spinellis, D., A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies (2004) ACM Comput Surv, 36 (4), pp. 335-371; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Given the scope, complexity, and dynamism of FinTech solutions, cyberattacks are inevitable, making enhanced security technology indispensable to ensuring future growth. Information leakage is one of the most common vulnerabilities and is still difficult to be prevented completely. The most promising approach to solving this problem is secure computation, which, thanks to its ability to process encrypted data, has proven to be a robust information leakage prevention technology. This paper discusses NEC's own contribution to Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) technology. In SMPC, data on multiple machines can be processed while maintaining the security of the data on each machine. In addition to explaining the technology itself, we will show how it could work in FinTech applications by reviewing some case studies centering around NEC's high-speed method and protection of information for authentication.","Authentication; Information leakage prevention; Secure computation secure multi-party computation; Security","Authentication; Security of data; Cyber security; Encrypted data; Information leakage; Multiple machine; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Security; Security technology; Cryptography",,,,,"About Macromill, , http://www.macromill.com/honote/20160405/report.html; Araki, T., Furukawa, J., Lindell, Y., Nof, A., Ohara, K., High-throughput semi-honest secure three-party computation with an honest majority (2016) ACM CCS; Furukawa, J., Lindell, Y., Nof, A., Weinstein, O., High-throughput secure three-party computation for malicious adversaries and an honest majority (2017) Eurocrypt, , to appear",,,,"NEC Mediaproducts",,,,,18805884,,,,"English","NEC Tech.

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-Touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","financial disintermediation; financial inclusion; financial technology; light-Touch/humble regulation; principles-based regulation; regulatory sandbox",,,,,,"John, A., Awrey, D., Davies, P., Enriques, L., Gordon, J.N., Mayer, C., Payne, J., (2016) Principles of Financial Regulation, , Oxford, UK: Oxford, University Press; Arner, D.W., Nathan Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm?

Five lessons learned are presented for organizations to better manage the challenges and to leverage the opportunities amidst the disruption of financial sector.

Payment is a presentative FinTech service, and there are a number of payment schemes in operation. However, there exists a high degree of heterogeneity among payment schemes in terms of payment process, transaction settlement method, and deployment of software agents. Accordingly, a payment cannot be established between any two different payment schemes. In this paper, we present a payment mediation process for mediating payment activities between two different schemes, and its software implementation. The platform allows payment transactions among currently available payment schemes such as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation of the platform as an assessment work. © 2016 IEEE.","FinTech Payment; Mediation; Platform","Information management; Financial service; FinTech Payment; It technologies; Mediation; Payment transactions; Platform; Proof of concept; Software implementation; Software agents",,,,,"De Reuver, M., Verschuur, E., Nikayin, F., Cerpa, N., Bouwman, H., Collective action for mobile payment platforms: A case study on collaboration issues between banks and telecom operators (2015) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14 (5), pp. 331-344. , September-October; Sam Sung Pay, , http://www.samsung.com/sec/Samsung-pay, Samsung Inc,Accessed: April 26,2016; Apple Pay, , https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay, Apple Inc,Accessed: March 15,2016; Android Pay, , https://developers.google.com/android-pay, Google Inc,Accessed: March 20,2016; Daswani, N., Boneh, D., Garcia-Molina, H., Ketchpel, S.P., Paepcke, A., SW aperoo: A simple wallet architecture for payments, exchanges, refunds, and other operations (1998) USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce; EMVCo Payment Tokenisation Specification Technical Framework, , https://www.emvco.com/downloadagreement.aspxid=945, EMVco LLC,Accessed: March 20,2016; Kuttner, K.N., McAndrews, J., Personal on-line payments (2001) Economic Policy Review, pp. 35-50. , December; Jaouad, B., Wadii, E.H., SouhaIl, E.G.E.H., Architecture of a mediation system for mobile payment (2014) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications(IJACSA), 5 (9), pp. 42-51; Swink, M.L., Calantone, R., Designmanufacturing integration as a mediator of antecedents to new product design quality (2004) Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on, 51 (4), pp. 472-482",,"Xu B.","Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology;Global Union Academy of Science and Technology;IEEE Beijing Section;Xi'an Peihua University","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IMCEC 2016","3 October 2016 through 5 October 2016",,126706,,9781467396127,,,"English","Proc.

Fintech is a new economic industry, comprised of companies that adopted the latest technologies to provide more efficient financial services than the traditional financial services. Fintech companies are generally small to medium sized startups trying to disintermediate existing financial systems. FinTech companies can be differentiated in several areas, based on its business solutions and target customers. In Korea, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending companies are the most prominent in the FinTech sector. P2P lending is a method of borrowing or lending money to individuals through online services without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. The P2P lending companies operate their services entirely online or mobile environment. Consequently, mobile P2P lending application users are dramatically increasing. Thus, it is worth evaluating the acceptance of the mobile apps of the P2P lending companies from a user’s perspective. This paper discusses user acceptance of the mobile P2P lending apps, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. We conclude that the users’ acceptance of mobile P2P lending apps are significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. These in turn influenced their attitude towards using mobile P2P lending apps and intention to use. © 2017 KSII.","APIC-IST 2016; FinTech; P2P Lending; P2P Lending Apps; P2P Lending Platform; Social Lending","Peer to peer networks; APIC-IST 2016; Financial institution; FinTech; P2p lending; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Social Lending; Technology acceptance model; Finance",,,,,"McAuley, D., What is FinTech?

At the same time it is challenging regulators. The key issue they face is how to balance the desire to encourage new businesses so as to intensify competition and provide better customer services in the sector, while protecting the system and consumers from excessively risky behaviour and potential disruption. For Indonesia the opportunity is very large given the uneven availability of finance and low levels of financial inclusion. This paper explores the new Indonesian regulation of platform lending in the light of standard regulatory problems, international experience with regulating the sector, and the particular needs of Indonesian development.

The Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may extend their authority over service providers to their supervised institutions. Meanwhile, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) lacks this authority for credit unions. The federal and state agencies that oversee Money Service Businesses (MSBs) also lack this authority. The regulatory authority over MSBs service providers is particularly interesting because of the rise of virtual currency businesses providing an alternative payment rail outside of traditional institutions, allowing small fintech startups to enter into the payment space. This chapter examines federal and state authority over third-party service providers and justifications thereof. It goes on to examine some of the more unique aspects of fintech entrants to the payment space and how their service providers should be treated along with other MSBs. Ultimately, this chapter recommends that private contract law between MSBs and their service providers be used to mitigate the risks in their relationship. Limited resources and duplicative regulatory costs between federal and state agencies as well as the relatively small size of the industry makes it inefficient to directly supervise third-party service providers. However, this chapter does not reject the possibility of future extensions of government authority as the industry and its potential impact over the financial system grows. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.","Bitcoin;

This study aims to provide an overview on FinTechs in China. It was examined why payment services and P2P lending are so popular in China and what are the determinants for the emergence of P2P lending platforms in different provinces in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a descriptive analysis of P2P lending in China and an empirical analysis of determinants of P2P lending in China. Findings: This descriptive analysis shows that the surge in the number of the P2P platforms in China follows an inverted U-shaped phenomenon. However, the outstanding balances of P2P lenders is still increasing, while average yields of P2P lenders have sharply plunged. The empirical findings indicate that P2P lending is more extensive in the region with more mobile phone subscriptions; outstanding balance of P2P lenders in region is negatively associated with the size of traditional banking sector; and the number of the P2P platforms in negatively related to the fixed assets investments in region, whereas average yield is positively associated with the fixed assets investments. Originality/value: Currently, almost no research papers with empirical analysis of FinTechs, especially P2P lenders, exist. This study estimates a simple model to find determinants of P2P lending. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; P2P lending; Shadow banking",,,,,,"Allen, F., Qian, J., Qian, M., Law, finance, and economic growth in China (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (1), pp. 57-116; Démurger, S., Infrastructure development and economic growth: an explanation or regional disparities in China?

Among them, the area that shows the growth potential of the Fintech corporation in the financial market is the Fintech. The spread of the Fintech in trying to graft the finance-related services with mobile and ICT, besides simple payment and transaction service, it is being expanded into more diverse areas such as loan, investment and asset management, but the awareness of the consumers is still very low. Thus, it is time that the need for researches related to diverse Fintech business is demanded. The ultimate purpose of the Fintech service is to eliminate the social cost's waste element occurring from issue of money by not using or reducing the usage of cash. But due to lack of infrastructure and perception, it seems that more active advertisement and security provision is needed.

The core technologies on convergence are mobile, smart and cloud. Because of popularization and progress on mobile device and service, the various patterns related with our consumption have been changed. There are many backgrounds in emergence of FinTech industry. In this study, we studied FinTech start-up firms. FinTech refers to a newly emerging industry and service fields through the fusion of finance and ICT. In this study, we studied on current status of FinTech firms. We deal with domestic firms such as Daum Kakao, LGU+. And we described In foreign firms such as Fidor Bank, Simple Online Bank, OnDeck, Stripe and Affirm. Eventually we analyzed problems of the current FinTech firms. In this study, we described several FinTech start-up firms. Many FinTech companies are especially in the payment sector. Two rapidly growing start-ups to notice for the recent five years are studied. A biggest hurdle in electrolyzation of financial service is personal information leakage therefore, biometrics to supplement it gains attention. According to gartner, bio authentication use ratio using mobile devices is forecast to grow from current 5-30%. However, damage may continue to one's life time if bio information leaks. The argument on user's psychological anxiety and human right violation needs to be solved. e-Payment services through non-financial companies like IT companies are on the rapid rise. Competition between financial companies and non-financial companies, between IT companies to preempt the e-payment market is fierce. As the FinTech market rapidly grows associated fields are expected to grow as well. Big data and crowd markets are forecast to grow together security and bio technology markets are also projected to gain attention, since security issue works as a huge hindrance factor for the future of the FinTech markets. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Banking; FinTech; Payment crowdfunding; Start-up; Technology",,,,,,"Amer, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, , University of New South Wales, Kensington, New South Wales; Chishti, S., Barberis, J., (2016) The FinTech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, p. 291. , Wiley, Chichester, England, UK; Drummer, D., Jerenz, A., Siebelt, P., Thaten, M., (2016) FinTech: Challenges and opportunities-how digitization is transforming the financial sector, , McKinsey & Company, New York, USA; Bank, F., (2017) Die Fidor smart community-gemeinsam mehr geld, , https://www.fidor.de/personal-banking/card, Fidor Bank, UK; Gulamhuseinwala, I., Bull, T., Lewis, S., FinTech is gaining traction and young, high-income users are the early adopters (2015) J.

This is relentlessly projected to affect competition in some parts of the financial system and to impact its structure and dynamics, calling upon policy- and law-makers to take a close look at the financial stability implications. The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework to aid supervisors, policy- and law-makers in managing risks and harnessing opportunities arising from the transition to the ""FinTech era"". Until now, ""FinTech"" has been vaguely associated with concepts like ""disruption"", ""decentralisation"" and ""disintermediation"". Very little efforts have been spent on explaining the relevance of each of them. Departing from the prevailing current, this paper deploys such concepts as filters in risk-profiling FinTech. According to our model, we identify four filters (economic function, disruptive potential, disintermediation, and decentralisation) against which to categorise ""FinTech"". The output of the filtering process is intended to facilitate the examination of questions relating to policy and regulatory responses.",,,,,,,"Global FinTech Survey 2016, , https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/advisory-services/FinTech/pwc-fintech-global-report.pdf, accessed 22 June 2017; Frame, White, Technological change, financial innovation, and diffusion in banking (2015) The Oxford Handbook of Banking, pp. 271-311. , Berger, Molyneux, and Wilson (eds.) 2nd edn, Oxford University Press; The disruptive implications of FinTech-policy themes for financial regulators (2017) Journal of Technology Law & Policy, 21 (1). , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2812667, CHIU accessed 22 June 2017; Walker, Financial technology law - A new beginning and a new future (2017) The International Lawyer, 50 (1). , 137ff; (2015) Fair and Effective Market Review, , Final Report, June; Schwarcz, Regulating shadow banking (2012) Review of Banking and Financial Law, 31 (1). , https://ssrn.com/abstract=1993185, accessed on 22 June 2017; Awrey, Complexity, innovation and the regulation of modern financial markets (2011) Harvard Business Law Review, 2 (2), pp. 235-294. , https://ssrn.com/abstract=1916649, Oxford Legal Studies Research Paper No. 49/2011 accessed 22 June 2017; Brummer, Disruptive technology and securities regulation (2015) Fordham Law Review, 84, pp. 977-980. , http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol84/iss3/6, writes accessed on 22 June 2017; Gorton, G.B., Metrick, A., (2010) Regulating the Shadow Banking System, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=1676947, or <http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1676947> accessed on 22 June 2017; (2016) Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Block Chain, , www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf, UK Government Office for Science accessed 22 June 2017; Arner, Barberis, Buckley, (2016) FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2847806, University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper No. 2016/035 accessed 22 June 2017; Maupin, (2017) Mapping the Global Legal Landscape of Blockchain Technologies, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2930077, accessed 22 June 2017; (2016) What is FinTech?, , www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/publications/viewpoints/assets/pwc-fsi-what-is-fintech.pdf, April; (2017) IOSCO Research Report on Financial Technologies (Fintech), , www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD554.pdf, February; (2015) RegTech is the New FinTech: How Agile Regulatory Technology is Helping Firms Better Understand and Manage their Risks, , https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/FinancialServices/ie-regtech-pdf.pdf, accessed 22 June 2017; Walker, Financial technology law - A new beginning a new future (2017) The International Lawyer, 50 (1), p. 137; (2015) Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Block Chain, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf, UK Government Office for Science A report by the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser, December; Christensen, (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma - When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Harvard Business Review Press; Christensen, Raynor, McDonald, (2015) What is Disruptive Innovation?, , https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation; Merton, A functional perspective of financial intermediation (1995) Financial Management, 24 (2), pp. 23-41. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/3665532, Silver Anniversary Commemoration, 1995 accessed 22 June 2017; Merton, Bodie, A conceptual framework for analyzing the financial environment (1995) The Global Financial System, a Functional Perspective, 1995, pp. 3-31. , Crane, Froot, Mason, Perold, Merton, Bodie, Sirri and Tufano (eds.)

FinTech companies are an important driver of innovation in the financial industry. By making financial transactions more user-friendly and transparent, these firms potentially contribute to financial stability and economic growth. The authors define and categorize the different market segments that have emerged. They further provide an assessment of current market volumes and make forecasts for the next 5, 10 and 20 years. Particular attention is given to the empirical findings resulting from scholarly research. Furthermore, the authors evaluate how the German FinTech market ranks relative to international standards. This book will appeal to finance and entrepreneurship researchers as well as practitioners from banking and tech industries. “This book offers a fresh and fascinating look at the FinTech market. The authors provide a rigorous economic analysis of the FinTech market in Germany and offer many insights that are of interest to practitioners, academics, and policymakers alike.” Professor Douglas Cumming, Schulich School of Business “Germany is one of the fastest growing FinTech markets in Europe.

In particular, the study analyses the systemic innovation nature of FinTech-based innovations. The main contribution of this research study is the development of systemic innovation model which can be used as a dynamic tool to track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion. The research also discusses the latest financial innovation of PromptPay FinTech – the e-payment system in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the case study approach to analyse the systemic innovation characteristics of FinTech-based innovations. This research offers a new systemic innovation model which is developed and can be used as a dynamic tool to track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion. The study uses FinTech-based innovations as case study samples to gain a better understanding concerning the systemic characteristics and the pattern of technology diffusion under the analytical framework of systemic innovation model. This research involves qualitative interviews with five major commercial banks in the financial services industry of Thailand. Findings: The analyses of findings show the systemic characteristics of FinTech-based innovations in the banking industry, both at a global scale and Thailand case. The analyses have shown that systemic characteristics of the innovation process are the outcome of interactions between the complexity of the innovation and the capabilities of innovators in managing the innovation. The insightful implications on the systemic nature of innovation give the trend and direction of FinTech-based innovation development in the banking industry. Originality/value: The main contribution which shows originality and value of this paper is the development of systemic innovation model. This research study develops a systemic innovation model to analyse the systemic characteristics which can be applied to all innovations in any industry.

Therefore, the model can be used to project the trend and diffusion of innovation competition in the banking industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Economic forecasting; Innovation; Strategy",,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Kantrow, A.M., (1983) Industrial Renaissance: Producing a Competitive Future for America, , Basic Books, New York, NY; Appleyard, M.M., Chesbrough, H., The dynamics of open strategy: from adoption to reversion (2017) Long Range Planning, 50 (3), pp. 310-321; Barras, R., Towards a theory of innovation in services (1986) Research Policy, 15 (4), pp. 161-173; Barras, R., Interactive innovation in financial and business services: the vanguard of the service revolution (1990) Research Policy, 19 (3), pp. 215-237; Carlsson, B., Internationalization of innovation systems: a survey of the literature (2006) Research Policy, 35 (1), pp. 55-67; Chesbrough, H.W., The era of open innovation (2003) Sloan Management Review, 44 (3), pp. 35-41; Chesbrough, H.W., (2003) Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Chesbrough, H.W., (2011) Open Services Innovation: Rethinking Your Business to Grow and Compete in A New Era, , Jossey Bass, San Francisco, CA; Chesbrough, H.W., Teece, D.J., When is virtual virtuous?

However, it is yet to be observed in Latvia to the same extent. This paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in Latvia compared to Europe. The paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in Latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The hypothesis of this paper is that Latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in Latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions.","Competition; Fintech; Innovation in financial services",,,,,,"(2015) The Future of FinTech and Banking: Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined?, , https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-future-fintech-banking, Accenture; Anikina, I.D., Gukova, V.A., Golodova, A.A., Chekalkina, A.A., Methodological aspects of prioritization of financial tools for stimulation of innovative activities (2016) European Research Studies Journal, 19 (2), pp. 100-112; (2016) Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, , https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201603.pdf, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; (2015) Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, , https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201503.pdf, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Chaia, A., Goland, T., Schiff, R., (2010) Counting the World's Unbanked, , http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/counting-the-worlds-unbanked; (2016) Opportuities for Mobile Financial Services to Engage Qualitative Research Findings, , https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/community/mobile/mfs_qualitative_research_report.pdf, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Fetai, B., Financial integration and financial development: Does financial integration matter?

Many of them are exploring blockchain applications to their multiple business lines, focusing in particular on post trading activities. Potential benefits include the reduction in counterparty risk and post trading costs as well as the increase of liquidity and transparency. At current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at Nasdaq and ASX. The mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least. Fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction. A coordination between market players and regulators is essential to guarantee the effective implementation of new technologies, as their benefits can be delivered only in presence of a common framework and a proper management of risks. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Design/methodology/approach: With a literature review on the global regulatory environment and the underlying risks related to Fintech, it looks into the formulation and implementation of complementary regulatory policies in the case of Hong Kong as a GFC. Relevant policy documents disclosed by the financial regulator on cybersecurity and pertinent issues are examined. Findings: Adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with Fintech, the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated firms with strategic controls. This study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks arising from Fintech. However, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift Fintech developments across borders. Research limitations/implications: As Fintech has only emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach. Further studies may utilize a longitudinal method to analyze and examine the regulatory measures undertaken by financial regulators in various GFCs. Originality/value: This study reveals a strategic approach adopted by an emerged GFC in embracing Fintech innovation that however brings about unidentified risks and potential frauds to its financial services sector. Pertinent anti-fraud and cybersecurity measures are highlighted. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cybersecurity; Fintech; Fraud; Global financial centre; Hong Kong; Risk-based approach",,,,,,"(2015) The Future of Fintech and Banking: digitally disrupted or reimaged?, , www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Dualpub_11/Accenture-Future-Fintech-Banking.pdf, (accessed, 21 November 2016;

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

The authors assume the general methodological approach of grounded theory to study four cases of financial technology platforms from Russia; the sample represents companies focusing both on solutions for the front end (consumers) and back end (middle of the value chain). The research finds that the top executives of the companies, which create and operate the digital platforms, have an approach to business strategy that is significantly different from that of the traditional business. They defy the pragmatism of predicting the market development and planning the company's actions in accordance with such predictions. Strategic paradigm of these companies is based on the notions of inclusivity, dynamism, and reliance on independent participants of a business ecosystem. Though a radical departure from the traditional business strategy, such an approach has brought demonstrable business success across the time span of a decade. The idea of “platform–ecosystem” can also be fruitful as a tool of solving important socioeconomic issues such as financial inclusion in the emerging markets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Baghbadorani, M.F., Harandi, A., A conceptual model for business ecosystem and implications for future research (2012) International Proceedings of Economics Development & Research, 52, pp. 82-86; Bonchek, M., Choudary, S.P., Three elements of a successful platform strategy (2013) Harvard Business Review, 92. , https://hbr.org/2013/01/three-elements-of-a-successful-platform, #x0026;, Retrieved September 21, 2015, from; Bourreau, M., Valletti, T., Enabling digital financial inclusion through improvements in competition and interoperability: What works and what doesn't?

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bank 3.0; Co-opetition Theory; FinTech; Investment in FinTech; PARTS; Taiwan bank industry; Taiwan FinTech Industry",,,,,,"(2016) Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, , https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, Accessed 10 Sept 2016; Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D.K., Mead, M., The case research strategy in studies of information systems (1987) MIS Q, 11 (3), pp. 369-386; Brandenburger, A., Nalebuff, B., (1996) Co-opetition, , Doubleday, New York; Cavaye, A.L., Case study research: a multi-faceted research approach for IS (1996) Inf Syst J, 6 (3), pp. 227-242; Chiu, L.T., Retrospect and prospect of financial industry development in Taiwan (2011) Econ Res, 11, pp. 171-197; (2015) Financial Supervisory Committee Big Data Project, , http://data.gov.tw/node/12077, Data.Gov.Tw, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Construct Digital Finance Environments, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=96&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=news_view.jsp&dataserno=201501130003&toolsflag=Y&dtable=News, Accessed 21 Sept 2016; (2015) The Act Governing Electronic Payment Institutions, , http://law.fsc.gov.tw/law/EngLawContent.aspx?Type=C&id=1802, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Regulations of Bank and Financial Holding Company Investing Fintech Firms, , http://law.banking.gov.tw/Eng/FLAW/FLAWQRY03.aspx?lsid=FL078705&keyword=10460003280, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Regulations of Industry of Information Service and Industry of Finance Technology Determined by the Competent Authority as Finance Related Industry, , http://law.banking.gov.tw/Eng/FLAW/FLAWQRY03.aspx?lsid=FL078705&keyword=10460003280, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Financial Technology Area, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=478&parentpath=0,7, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Basic Financial Data, , http://www.banking.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=157&parentpath=0,4&mcustomize=bstatistics_view.jsp&serno=201105120009, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Fintech Development Strategy White Paper, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=96&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=news_view.jsp&dataserno=201605120002&aplistdn=ou=news,ou=multisite,ou=chinese,ou=ap_root,o=fsc,c=tw&dtable=News, Accessed 4 Oct 2016; (2016) P2P Will Not Set up Regulation, , http://udn.com/news/story/7239/1793803, Accessed 10 Oct 2016; (2016), https://www.fintechweekly.com/fintech-definition, Fintech weekly (nd) Fintech definition, Accessed 26 Aug; Hill, C., Lynn, L., Producing human services why do agencies collaborate?

Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly visible in the popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German popular press including the subjects discussed in the context of FinTech. This study is the first one to reflect the media perspective on the FinTech phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the growing knowledge on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and digital innovation literature. These study contributes to research in the areas of information systems, finance and interdisciplinary social sciences.

In this article, we report the cash-based monetary practices of one Ethiopian rural community and identify their implications for the design of new financial technology. Particularly, we focus on addressing the question, What characteristic features should go into the design of mobile money application(s) to embody a rural Ethiopian community’s money practices in social (marriage and death) and religious contexts? Primary data on everyday practices of the community were collected. Analysis of our data reveals that new financial technology design should support lived experiences such as embedded social meaning, segregated and aggregate money control, restricted money use, identity extension and hiding, refusal and acceptance of donations, disclosed and secret money practices, and assigning aesthetics to money. The article concludes by discussing possible ways of mapping these concepts into financial system design, thus contributing toward the development of cashless transactions and a cashless society.

Known as FinTech, these services influence competitive advantage for their ability to create innovation beyond the framework of conventional financial services. Acting as an enabler for creating innovation, Hitachi is taking a close look at AI, and working on its utilization in the financial sector. This article looks at phenomena such as FinTech and the IoT as precursors of changes in the financial industry. It discusses how AI is being used in the financial industry through activities designed to raise management KPIs by quantitatively evaluating organizational activity levels from action data acquired from wearable terminals.

According to him, their specificity contents define and separate the appropriate conditions for debt and equity governances. Our paper extends his contribution by arguing that, while the degree of specificity of the technology influences the choice of the governance, also the reverse is true: equity and debt governances involve different degrees of specificity. Thus, we have to deal with finance-technology complementarities, which can generate multiple organizational equilibria. Their possible inefficiency provides an argument for regulating the limits of each form of governance and for understanding the variety of arrangements existing in real life economies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Corporate governance and finance; Institutional complementarity; Organizational equilibria; Transaction costs","corporate strategy; debt; finance; governance approach; investment; transaction cost",,,,,"Aghion, P., Bolton, P., An incomplete contracts approach to financial contracting (1992) Review of Economic Studies, 59, pp. 473-494; Aguilera, R.V., Jackson, R., The cross-national diversity of corporate governance: dimensions and determinants (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28 (3), pp. 447-465; Aguilera, R.V., Jackson, R., Comparative and international corporate governance (2010) The Academy of Management Annals, 4 (1), pp. 485-556; Allen, F., Gale, D., (2000) Comparing Financial Systems, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Amable, B., (2003) The Diversity of Modern Capitalisms, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Amable, B., Ernst, E., Palombarini, S., How do financial markets affect industrial relations: an institutional complementarity approach (2005) Socio-Economic Review, 3 (2), pp. 311-330; Aoki, M., The contingent governance of teams: analysis of institutional complementarity (1994) International Economic Review V, 35 (3), pp. 657-676; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward A Comparative Institutional Analysis, , MIT Press, Cambridge MA; Aoki, M., (2010) Corporations in Evolving Diversity, , Cognition, Governance and Institutions, Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York; Belloc, F., Pagano, U., Knowledge enclosures, forced specializations and investment crisis (2012) The European Journal of Comparative Economics, 9 (3), pp. 445-483; Belloc, M., Pagano, U., Politics-business co-evolution paths: workers' organization and capitalist concentration (2013) International Review of Law and Economics, 33, pp. 23-66; Belloc, M., Pagano, U., Co-evolution of politics and corporate governance (2009) International Review of Law and Economics, 29, pp. 106-114; Bowles, S., Pagano, U., Economic integration, cultural standardisation and the politics of social insurance (2006) Globalization and Egalitarian Redistribution, pp. 306-319. , Princeton University Press, Princeton, P.

With a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general. This suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market. © 2016 Korean Securities Association.","End-to-end; Entry; FinTech; Front-end; Retail payment",,,,,,"(2014) The Boom in Global Fintech Investment: A New Growth Opportunity for London, Technical Report, , http://www.accenture.com/Microsites/fsinsights/capital-markets-uk/Documents/Accenture-Global-Boom-in-Fintech-Investment.pdf, Accenture; Anderson, R., Moore, T., The economics of information security (2006) Science, 314, pp. 610-613; Armstrong, M., Competition in two-sided markets (2006) The RAND Journal of Economics, 37, pp. 668-691; Baxter, W.F., Bank interchange of transactional paper: Legal and economic perspectives (1983) Journal of Law and Economics, 26, pp. 541-588; Bradford, T., Hayashi, F., Hung, C., Rosati, S., Sullivan, R.J., Wang, Z., Weiner, S.E., Nonbanks and risk in retail payments: EU and U.S. EU (2009) Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security, , M.

In addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables. Results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables. Further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use. The implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type Fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect. © Research India Publications.","Elaboration likelihood model; Fintech; K pay; Mobile payment service",,,,,,"Petty, R., Cacioppo, J.T., (1986) Communication and Persuasion: Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change, , Springer-Verlag; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; (2015) Financial Terminology Dictionary, , http://fsc.go.kr/know/wrd_list.jsp; Schierz, P.G., Schilke, O., Wirtz, B.W., Understanding Consumer Acceptance of Mobile Payment Services: An Empirical Analysis (2010) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9 (3), pp. 209-216; Joo, Y.J., Chung, A.K., Jung, Y.J., An Analysis of the Impact of Cyber University Students ‘Mobile Self-efficacy, Mobility on Intention to Use in Mobile Learning Service Linked to E-learning (2015) Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education, 18 (1), pp. 55-68; Bhattacherjee, A., Sanford, C., Influence Processes for Information Technology Acceptance: An Elaboration Likelihood Model (2006) MIS Quarterly, 30 (4), pp. 805-825; Kim, Y.H., Choi, B.M., Choi, J.I., A Study on the Successful Adoption of IOT Services: Focused on iBeacon and Nearby (2015) Korean Journal of Information Technology Services, 14 (3), pp. 217-236; Lee, J.E., Shin, M.S., Factors for the Adoption of Smartphone-based Mobile Banking: On User’s Technology Readiness and Expertise (2011) Journal of Society for E-Business Studies, 16 (4), pp. 155-172; Jarvenpaa, S.L., Tractinsky, J., Vitale, M., Consumer Trust in an Internet Store (2000) Information Technology and Management, 1 (1-2), pp. 45-71; Chungand, S.Y., Park, C., Factors Influencing Acceptance of Mobile Service: Moderating Effects of Service Type (2007) Information Systems Review, 9 (1), pp. 23-44; Foon, Y.S., Fah, B.C.Y., Internet Banking Adoption in Kuala Lumpur:An Application of UTAUT Model (2011) International Journal of Business and Management, 6 (4), p. 161; Van Slyke, C., Shim, J.T., Johnson, R., Jiang, J.J., Concern for Information Privacy and Online Consumer Purchasing (2006) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 7 (1), pp. 415-444; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer’s willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers. This not only impacts on competition, it represents major challenges for policymakers, authorities and consumers alike. © 2016 Springer Verlag.

FIDO services are adapting a variety of service areas such as easy payment, money transfer, ATM withdrawal/savings, and single sign-on, etc. Because FIDO service uses standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication and securely saves a user's bio-information in the smartphone. But when registered, FIDO only confirms the match between pre-enrolled fingerprints and the one on the registration process. In other words, FIDO is not able to verify the person's identity. The user has to register his/her biometric information in each sites. It is our purpose to solve these problems by implementing FIDO and PKI technologies adapted in current FIDO service and accredited certification system. The proposed secure biometric authentication framework provides the centralized biometric authentication framework in Fintech environment that a variety of services need the interoperability of user's biometric information in order to protect user's privacy and increase convenience of customers. © 2016 SERSC.","Biometric authentication; FIDO(Fast Identity Online); PKI(Public Key Infrastructure)","Authentication; Biometrics; Interoperability; Public key cryptography; Bioinformation; Biometric authentication; Biometric informations; Certification systems; FIDO(Fast Identity Online); Money transfers; Public key infrastructure; Registration process; Cryptography",,,,,"Kim, Y., Park, Y.J., Choi, J., 'The Adoption of Mobile Payment Services for Fintech' (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (2), pp. 1058-1061; Lee, S.H., Lee, D.W., 'A Study on Fintech Based on Actual Cases' (2016) International Journal of u-and e-Service, Science and Technology, 9 (8), pp. 439-448; Stokkenes, M., Ramachandra, R., Busch, C., Biometric Authentication Protocols on Smartphones: An Overview (2016) 9th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks, pp. 136-140; Cho, S.R., Choi, D.S., Jin, S.H., Lee, H.H., (2014) Passwordless Authentication Technology-FIDO, , Electronics and Telecommunications Trends; Nguyen, K., Authentication and identification-Taking the user into account (2014) Datenschutz und Datensicherheit-DuD, 38 (7), pp. 467-469. , July; Lyang Kim, G., Deok Lim, J., Nyeo Ki, J., Secure user authentication based on the trusted platform for mobile devices (2016) Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, , December; Thiemann, T., ""Picking the right path to mobile biometric authentication"" (2016) Biometric Technology Today, pp. 5-8. , February; Machani, S., Philpott, R., Srinivas, S., Kemp, J., Hodges, J., FIDO UAF Architectural Overview (2014) FIDO Alliance, , December; Jung Kim, J., Hong, S.-P., Study on the Accredited Certification System without Password using FIDO (2015) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, , June; https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/online-certificate-status-protocol.html",,,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,17389976,,,,"English","Int.

Within 40 years the country went from a mono-bank model to one composed of hundreds of wholly-owned State banks and joint stock commercial banks. Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015. Therefore the author submit that the emergence of the P2P sector in China is neither new, nor unexpected. Ultimately, this systemic shift caused by the P2P sector offers China a regulatory and market reform opportunity as the shadow has been brought to the light. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","China; Financial globalization; Financial innovation; Financial regulation; Financial technology; FinTech; RegTech; Regulatory technology",,,,,,"(2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 84; Zhou, W., Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., (2015) Regulation of Digital Financial Services in China: Last Mover Or First Mover?, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2660050; (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 63. , 2nd edition; The China Development Bank (CDB) and the China Exim Bank (CEB); Martin, M.F., Chinas Banking System: Issues for Congress’ (2012) Congressional Research Service, p. 2; Cheng, J., (2012) China: A New Stage of Development for an Emerging Superpower, p. 336. , City of University Hong Kong Press; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 54. , 2nd edition; Martin, M.F., China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress (2012) Congressional Research Service, p. 26; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 84. , 2nd edition; Arner, D.W., (2007) Financial Stability, Economic Growth, and the Role of Law, p. 225. , Cambridge University Press; Martin, M.F., ; Bell, S., Feng, H., The Rise of the People’s Bank of China (2013) The Politics of Institutional Change, , Harvard University Press; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 124. , Banking in China, 2nd edition; Barberis, J., A Crack in the Great Wall – Too-Big-To-Fail Them: A Societal Perspective, p. 36; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 44. , Congressional Research Service; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 58; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 14. , Oxford University Press USA; Tsai, K.S., (2004) Back-Alley Banking: Private Entrepreneurs in China, , Cornell University Press; Avgouleas, E., (2012) Governance of Global Financial Markets: The Law, The Economics, The Politics, p. 106. , Cambridge University Press; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 144. , Oxford University Press USA; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 144. , Oxford University Press USA; Zhang, J., (2013) Inside China's Shadow Banking: The Next Subprime Crisis?, p. 91. , Enrich Professional Publishing; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 7. , Congressional Research Service; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 44. , Congressional Research Service; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 21. , Oxford University Press USA; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 2. , Congressional Research Service; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 16. , Oxford University Press USA; Hsu, S., Li, J., Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives Oxford The Post-American World; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 35. , (Oxford University Press USA, 2009), 133.University Press USA; Zhang, Z., (2015) Overcoming Challenges of Internet Finance Innovation in Hong Kong, , May, HKIFA; Zakaria, F., The Post-American World, p. 34. , Release 2.0 (W.

Financial technologies (FinTech) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. Start-up service providers, search engines, and social networks have expanded their services ""interfering"" in the fields traditionally covered by banks. The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations.

In parallel with the regulatory changes, the banks are subject to pressure from accelerated technology development and social changes. These two factors influence the behavior of customers and induce changes in the customer relationship management (CRM). Taking the example of retail banking, the factors and their impacts are explained. Additionally, a view on the FinTech industry is presented, highlighting areas where traditional financial institutions are losing market share to technology-savvy and socially oriented new ventures with exceptional CRM capabilities. The conclusion contains proposed strategic actions that need to be undertaken in order to prepare the financial services industry for managing customer relationships in the increasingly technosocial environment. © 2016.

Besides the misjudged risks generated by fi nancial innovation as well as fi nancial pathology and general incomprehension of fi nance as such, two further misconceptions are of interdisciplinary nature. On the one hand, the risk-Type that was brought to the surface by the Credit Crunch was systemic risk; a risk of complexity and dimensions that was corollary only to the Great Depression erupting in 1929. From a legal perspective, this meant unprecedented interpenetration of various branches of law, from mortgage and corporate to securities law. The central piece in the puzzle - asset securitization - was a synergic product of these. The fi rst conclusion the paper draws is that in the light of this there is a need for a new legal discipline - the law of fi nance - that would spread over all these branches of law (internal inter-disciplinarity). On the other hand, both the Credit Crunch as well as the subsequent developments on fi nancial markets show that understanding fi nance and the risks inherent to it are not only becoming increasingly problematic (not only for lawyers) but that some of the risks are unidentifi able (""unknown unknowns""). Finance is inherently complex, yet further exacerbating factors are the growing presence of technology, mathematization of fi nance (and economics) and the possible synergic effects of various, often seemingly not linked, fi nancial products. The second claim this paper makes consequently is that legal scholarship should face, comprehend and reckon with the roles other disciplines increasingly play in fi nance (external inter-disciplinarity) and the fundamentally altered nature of fi nance. Subscribing to the conclusion - on an abstract and theoretical level - that the looming crises should be perceived as multi-disciplinary phenomena that as such require multi-disciplinary panacea and more cooperation from the affected disciplines would be easy. In reality, however, little seems to have changed. Suffi ce to take a look at law school curricula to realize that actually few have recipes for such seemingly simple but practical questions as how to teach the law of fi nance, especially where consensus has not been reached even on whether teach it at all. Equally heavy dilemmas are already presented for regulators or judges when deciding on issues from the realms of fi nance law.","Finance law; Financial innovation; Inter-disciplinarity; Law versus regulation; Mathematization",,,,,,"Cossin, D., Financial models create a false sense of security (2011) Financial Times, , 05.09.2011; Csaba, L., (2009) Crisis in Economics?

This book focuses on the role of technology in global finance and reflects on the ethical and societal meaning and impact of financial information and communication technologies (ICTs). Exploring the history, metaphysics, and geography of money, algorithms, and electronic currencies, the author argues that financial ICTs contribute to impersonal, disengaged, placeless, and objectifying relations, and that in the context of globalization these ‘distancing’ effects render it increasingly difficult to exercise and ascribe responsibility. Caught in the currents of capital, it seems that both experts and lay people have lost control and lack sufficient knowledge of what they are doing. There is too much epistemic, social, and moral distance. At the same time, the book also shows that these electronically mediated developments do not render global finance merely ‘virtual’, for its technological practices remain material and place–bound, and the ethical and social vulnerabilities they create are no less real. Moreover, understood in terms of technological practices, global finance remains human through and through, and there is no technological determinism. Therefore, Money Machines also examines the ways in which contemporary techno-financial developments can be resisted or re–oriented in a morally and socially responsible direction – not without, but with technology. As such, it will appeal to philosophers and scholars across the humanities and the social sciences with interests in science and technology, finance, ethics and questions of responsibility. © Mark Coeckelbergh 2015.

But if user’s password is hacked in one insecure website, it is highly possible to get cracked in other sites as well, because the user usually uses the same passwords, allowing identity fraud, theft or massive data spill. As part of enhancing the security of password, user’s password is getting more difficult remember because it has requirements for the composition typically dictating minimum length and required special characters and numbers and so on. Therefore, it is our purpose to suggest biometric-based single sign-on system using FIDO that uses a suitable for FinTech by analyzing the challenges and problems of current password-based SSO system. The proposed biometric-based SSO system is implementing FIDO’s biometric authentication, instead of using password, this system would benefit everyone who wants to have a safe and convenient smartphone authentication environment. © Research India Publications.","Biometric; Fast Identity Online; FIDO; Password; PKI; Single sign-on",,,,,,"Radha, V., Hitha Reddy, D., A Survey on Single Sign-On Techniques (2012) Procedia Technology, 4, pp. 134-139; Das, A., Bonneau, J., Caesar, M., Borisov, N., Wang, X., (2014) The Tangled Web of Password Reuse Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS), , Feb; Kim, J.-J., Hong, S.-P., A study on the accredited certification system without password using fido(Fast identity online) (2015) International Journal of Applied Engineering, 10 (13), pp. 33617-33619. , Research; Chai, S.-W., Min, K.-S., Lee, J.-H., A study of issues about Accredited Certification methods in Korea (2015) International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 9 (3), pp. 77-84; Machani, S., Philpott, R., Srinivas, S., Kemp, J., Hodges, J., (2014) FIDO UAF Architectural Overview, , FIDO Alliance, December; David, B.M., Erson, C.A., Nascimento, R.T., (2011) A Framework for Secure Single Sign-On, , IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive; Nair, A., Security issues of single sign on web services (2015) Soft-Computing and Networks Security (ICSNS), 2015 International Conference, , 25-27 Feb; Wu, Z.Y., Chung, Y., Lai, F., Chen, T.S., A password-based user authentication scheme for the integrated EPR information system (2012) Journal of Medical Systems; Vaithyasubramanian, S., Christy, A., A Scheme to Create Secured Random Password Using Markov Chain (2014) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 26, pp. 809-814. , November; Stobert, E., Biddle, R., The Password Life Cycle: User Behaviour in Managing Passwords (2014) Proc.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,"credit provision; financial services; institutional framework; lending behavior; small and medium-sized enterprise; Japan",,,,,"Boot, A.W.A., Relationship banking: What do we know?

This is so, as in the current situation, the south tends to be dominated by the climate policies of northern countries and climate finance largely supports single projects and technology transfer that are not embedded in a broader policy framework in southern countries. Adopting own stringent policies could help to counteract this and to channel these financial means to their most beneficial use. This could help southern countries to follow an agenda that is different from the fossil fuel based development path of the north. Such a ""green new deal"" could be a promising economic and technological development strategy. Stringent climate policies would strengthen the southern countries in the international climate negotiations and southern countries could take the lead in the climate change mitigation debate. Technology transfer and the carbon finance sector would play a crucial role for this. Climate policy and climate finance could thus be used to set a new stage, where the south is not at a disadvantage with respect to the north. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Barnes, D., Openshaw, K., Smith, K., van der Plas, R., The design and diffusion of improved cooking stoves (1993) The World Bank Research Observer, 8, pp. 119-141. , doi:10.1093/wbro/8.2.119; Baron, R., Buchner, B., Ellis, J., (2009) Sectoral Approaches and the Carbon Market, , Paris, OECD; Bhat, P.R., Chanakya, H.N., Ravindranath, N.H., Biogas plant dissemination: Success story of sirsi, india (2001) Energy for Sustainable Development, 5 (1), pp. 39-46. , doi:10.1016/S0973-0826(09)60019-3; Borges da Cunha, K., Walter, A., Rei, F., Cdm implementation in brazil's rural and isolated regions: The amazonian case (2007) Climatic Change, 84 (1-2), pp. 111-129. , doi:10.1007/s10584-007-9272-1; Brown, J., Vigneri, M., Sosis, K., (2009) Innovative Carbon-Based Funding for Adaptation, , http://www.odi.org.uk/ccef/resources/reports/s0198_oecd_adaptation.pdf, Overseas Development Institute.

The value of the asset lies in its transactional relations with other assets in the ecosystem or in other words being part of the architecture of related assets. It is argued that the deployment of financial trading software, as a product in brokerage houses in the emerging securities trading ecosystem in India by the software firm called Financial Technologies (FT), hastened institutionalization of new rules governing transactions embedded in the software design. As a result, FT implicitly collaborated with the regulator and other ecosystem participants who coordinated the innovation in design of the ecosystem. The software firm went on to expand the market for its own products (trading software) by incubating exchange ventures. This was achieved through a strategy of spawning of linked subsidiaries that led to both a growth of the trading ecosystem and further entrenchment of the innovated ecosystem. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Bachelard, G., (1971) On Poetic Imagination and Reverie, , (C.Gaudin, Trans.).

This paper will benefit educators in schools of computer science or schools of business considering enhancement of computing curricula to be contemporary with the demands of industry.© 2010 EDSIG (Education Special Interest Group of the AITP).","Computer science; Computing curricula; Entrepreneurship; Interdisciplinarity; Technolo-gy","Business entrepreneurs; Computer science students; Computing curricula; Critical area; Current models; Entrepreneurship; Financial industry; Interdisciplinarity; Technology entrepreneurship; Theory and practice; Computer science; Curricula; Education computing; Information systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Engineering education",,,,,"Berryman, S., Bailey, T., (1992) The Double Helix of Education and the Economy, , Institute on Education and the Economy of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York; Bradbeer, J., Barriers to interdisciplinarity: Disciplinary discourses and student learning (1999) Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 23 (3), pp. 381-396. , DOI 10.1080/03098269985326; Bransford, J., Brown, A., Cocking, R., Dono-Van, M., Pellegrino, J., (2000) How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, , National Academy Press, Washing-ton, D.C; Charney, A., Libecap, G., (2000) Impact of Entrepreneurship on Education, , Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurship; Field, A., Business incubators are growing up: They are broadening their reach to include more tech-savvy, time-pressed entrepreneurs (2009) Business Week, p. 076. , November 16; Gates, A.Q., Discovery, innovation and creativity: The core of computing (2010) IEEE Computer, pp. 98-100. , February; McEachern, C., What makes a good quant?

In this article, we examine a new technology application which is coming into its own around the world, in association with the revolution in wireless connectivity: mobile payments. Although there are likely to be nuances and surprises with this technology application, we caution the reader to recognize that many of the same economic forces will be at work as were with other financial services and related technology applications in the past. We apply a robust evaluative framework that permits identification of the relevant stakeholders and applicable theory in the analysis of consumer, firm, business process, market, industrial and social issues. Our findings are intended to guide senior managers in dealing with the economic aspects of mobile payments, and to help identify some important directions for the research. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Through NGOs, government agencies and banks, vast numbers of self-help groups have been established in recent years: as self-reliant autonomous local financial intermediaries. 85% of the members are women; in India, they have proven to be the better savers, borrowers and investors. Most of them are from the lowest castes and other disadvantaged groups. The SHGs mobilize their own savings, transform them into loans to members and plow their earnings from interest income back into equity. On that basis, SHGs and banks enter into commercial relations of mutual benefit, with low bank and client transaction costs and low risks. In the absence of interest rate restrictions and with repayment rates >99%, SHG banking is highly profitable - a message that has convinced hesitant bank managers in increasing numbers. SHGs are now forming local networks with their own cooperative financial institutions. The program has turned into a social movement, with high expansion rates in recent years. Fuelled by competence and enthusiasm at all stakeholder levels, it expands rapidly throughout India, including marginal and tribal areas. It is probably the world's largest and most successful microfinance program for the rural poor - outstanding in its emphasis on self-reliance and local autonomy. NABARD is now facing the combined challenges of how to disseminate the approach throughout India and the region; and how to continue financing the incremental costs of technical and financial assistance to the participating agencies. This calls for a coordinated donor effort: with the objective of strengthening and mainstreaming the program in India and disseminating it throughout the Asia region.",,"banking; credit provision; rural finance; savings; self help; India",,,,,"(2000) NABARD and microFinance, 1999-2000, , NABARD, Mumbai, NABARD; Nanda, Y.C., (1997) Linking Banks and Self-Help Groups in India and the Role of NGOs: Lessons Learned and Future Perspective, , Eschborn, GTZ; Bangkok, APRACA; Nanda, Y.C., (1999) Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory Framework for MicroFinance Report, , Mumbai, NABARD; Puhazhendhi, V., Satyasai, K.J.S., (2000) Microfinance for Rural People: An Impact Evaluation, , Mumbai, NABARD; Srinivasan, G., (1995) Group Approach to Empowerment of Rural Women: IFAD Experience in Tamil Nadu State, , Lucknow, Bankers Institute of Rural Development; Srinivasan, G., (1998) Building a Future - Group by Group: Case Studies of Self-Help Groups in India, , ed., Lucknow, Bankers Institute of Rural Development; Srinivasan, G., (1999) Financial to Social Capital: Role of Banks, 28 (1), pp. 53-62. , Prajnan; Clar de Jesus, R., (1997) Assessment of Linkage Banking Projects in Asia: Synthesis Report, , Eschborn, GTZ; Bangkok, APRACA -Case Study 1: PHBK, Indonesia (D.

The focus has rightly been placed on direct contact, through over or clandestine means, between US organizations that are engaged in the development or manufacture of such technology and foreign countries. Avenues of indirect contact and/or access have, however, received less attention. This survey is a review of the various elements of one such avenue-foreign control over or presence in the US financial community. Since finance is an essential element of economic activity and US policy strongly endorses the unfettered freedom of movement of all aspects of economic activity across national borders, a strong foreign presence in the American financial sector is expected and welcomed. Yet the obvious use of finance to control and channel production and distribution leads to consideration of the ways in which foreign interests in acquiring or affecting sensitive technologies can be advanced through financial means. © 1991 Technology Transfer Society.",,,,,,,,"Harmon, J.D.; Political Science Dept., St. John Fisher College, Rochester, 14618, NY, United States",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",,,,,08929912,,,,"English","J Technol Transfer",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249925715

However, research on mechanisms, by which financial technology affects customer intention to use financial processes, is very fragmented. Thus, relying on process virtualization theory, we study the effect of financial technology implementation on intention to use via relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness of processes. The results of our conjoint experiment with 302 participants indicate that relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness jointly transmit the effect of financial technology implementation on customer intention to use financial processes. Our results further suggest that financial technology implementation generally increases customer intention to use financial processes. Our study integrates research on financial technology and process virtualization by explaining customer intention to use processes with financial technology through process readiness, and supports practitioners in addressing the needs of financial services customers. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Conventional services offered by the incumbents are now disaggregated by a growing number of Fintech players, leading to the construction of new business models and partnerships. And yet, there remains a lack of research on how banks are developing their capabilities in the face of digital disruption and the outcomes they generate in the process. Toward bridging this gap, our research draws on the global survey and interviews conducted by a multinational law firm in unpacking the capability development process in banks. In doing so, our findings offer insights into the dynamic capability development in banks in the face of the digital disruption that is transforming the financial landscape globally. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.
